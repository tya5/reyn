# The `.reyn/` directory layout

This is the canonical reference for what lives under a project's `.reyn/` directory:
the five-way classification of every subtree, which subtrees are **recovery-core**
(captured + restored by time-travel), the **write-gate** rule a skill author hits, and
where a new subsystem should put its data.

`.reyn/` holds Reyn's own plumbing under the project root. The organizing principle is
**ownership + recovery role**: Reyn time-travels the state it *authors* and that *affects
its in-memory runtime* — not the user's project files, and not operator-owned config.

> **Rewind mechanics** (how recovery-core is reconstructed — WAL replay + snapshot
> generations, seq addressing, rewind-record append, atomicity) live in
> [Time travel](../../concepts/runtime/time-travel.md). This doc owns *what is in `.reyn/`*;
> that doc owns *how rewind works*.

## Classification

A `.reyn/` subtree is **recovery-core** iff it (1) is authored by the run (agent/runtime,
not the operator) **and** (2) affects in-memory runtime state that recovery reconstructs.
Everything else is excluded, by one of four reasons:

| Category | Handling on rewind / recovery | Subtrees |
|---|---|---|
| **recovery-core** | captured + restored (reconstructed) | `state/`, `config/` |
| **persist** (knowledge / decisions) | survives rewind — never reverted | `memory/`, `approvals.yaml` |
| **audit** (write-only record) | kept as a record, never restored | `events/`, `traces/`, `logs/`, `audit-trail/`, `tool-results/`, `media/` |
| **cache** (derived) | rebuilt after restore | `cache/` (`index/`, `action_index/`, `registry-cache/`, `*_cursor`) |
| **outside** (operator/user-owned) | not Reyn-managed for time-travel | `reyn.yaml`, `secrets.env`, `oauth_tokens.json`, `capability_profiles/` |

```

`reyn.yaml`, `secrets.env`, `oauth_tokens.json`, and `capability_profiles/` are
**operator/user-owned** and live under the project root / `.reyn/` but are **outside**
Reyn's time-travel — they are never captured or reverted.

### Move map (clean break, no migration)

The reorg has **no backward-compat shim**: old top-level paths simply stop being
read/written. Anyone with an older `.reyn/` (config files directly under `.reyn/`, caches
mixed in at the top level) should know things moved:

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| `.reyn/mcp.yaml`, `.reyn/cron.yaml`, `.reyn/hooks.yaml`, `.reyn/integrations.yaml` | `.reyn/config/<x>.yaml` |
| `.reyn/index/sources.yaml` | `.reyn/config/index/sources.yaml` |
| `.reyn/index/` (data), `.reyn/action_index/`, `.reyn/registry-cache/` | `.reyn/cache/…` |
| `.reyn/approvals.yaml` | **unchanged** (top-level — it is *persist*, not recovery-core config) |

## <a id="recovery-core"></a>Recovery-core: what the WAL + snapshot generators write

Recovery-core has two tiers — **authoritative** and **derived** — both reconstructed by the
same rewind path (WAL replay + snapshot generations — see
[Time travel](../../concepts/runtime/time-travel.md)):

- **Authoritative** (the recovery TRUTH — write-gated):
  - `.reyn/state/wal.jsonl` — the append-only, seq'd WAL: the complete event history
    everything else is replayed from. Also `.reyn/state/tasks.db`,
    `.reyn/state/budget_ledger.jsonl`.
  - `.reyn/config/<x>.yaml` — the agent-edited config registries. Each mutation goes
    through a dedicated op that writes a **full-state config generation** (seq-keyed,
    truncation-surviving); the `.yaml` is materialised from the generation at the target
    seq on rewind.
  - `.reyn/state/agent_identity/<name>@<seq>.json` — per-agent identity + frozen spawn
    lineage, recorded as a **full-state generation** (seq-keyed, truncation-surviving).
    The WAL event is dropped below the truncation floor, so rewind reconstructs the
    ⊆-parent cap from the generation — without it a long-lived agent's child runs
    un-capped on rewind.
- **Derived** (reconstructable from the authoritative state — NOT write-gated):
  - `.reyn/agents/<name>/state/`: `snapshot.json`, `generations/gen-<seq>.json`,
    `sessions/<sid>/…`. Runtime snapshots are seq-keyed generations reconstructable from
    WAL replay (fall back to an earlier generation, or replay from genesis). A corrupted
    snapshot is *recoverable*, not data loss — the same reconstructability logic as
    `cache/`. Agent-identity and lineage are likewise stored as seq-keyed generation
    snapshots (truncation-surviving, same generation-store pattern as config). (This is
    why the write-gate, below, covers only the authoritative tier.)

## The recovery-core write-gate (the rule you hit as a skill author)

**A raw `file.write` to `.reyn/config/` or `.reyn/state/` is DENIED.** The
**authoritative** recovery-core (the WAL at `.reyn/state/` + the `.reyn/config/` registries —
see [above](#recovery-core)) must be mutated through a **dedicated op** — never a generic
`file.write` — so the change lands in the recovery stream (WAL entry or config generation)
and can be reconstructed or reverted on rewind. The directory boundary *is* the write-gate
boundary. (The *derived* per-agent snapshots under `.reyn/agents/<name>/state/` are
reconstructable from the WAL, so they are not write-gated — a corrupted snapshot is
recoverable, not data loss.)

To change config, call the dedicated op (which writes the `.yaml` as a **new config generation**):

- MCP servers → `mcp_install` / `mcp_drop_server`
- cron → `cron_register` / `cron_unregister` / `cron_enable`
- hooks → `hooks_add`
- index sources → the index ops

`approvals.yaml` (top-level *persist*) is likewise write-gated — it is written only via the
permission-approval flow (`_persist`), never a raw `file.write`. `memory/`, `cache/`, and
other non-recovery-core `.reyn/` paths are ordinary writable zones.

## Where does a new subsystem put its data?

Ask the two recovery-core questions:

1. **Is it run-authored AND does it affect in-memory runtime state that recovery
   reconstructs?** → **recovery-core**: put it under `state/` (and write it through a
   WAL-emitting durable path or a dedicated op — never a raw `file.write`). If it's a
   config-style registry the agent mutates, put it under `config/` and give it a dedicated
   op that writes a config generation (full-state, seq-keyed).
2. Otherwise pick the exclusion that fits:
   - rebuildable from other state → `cache/`
   - a write-only forensic record → `events/` (or a sibling audit dir)
   - knowledge / a decision that must **survive** rewind → `memory/` (persist)
   - operator/user-owned → it does not belong under Reyn's managed tree.

When in doubt, do **not** default to recovery-core — an over-broad recovery-core entry
either bloats capture or, if it can't be reconstructed, breaks rewind.
