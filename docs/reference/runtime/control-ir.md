# Control IR

Control IR is the list of side-effect operations the LLM may emit. The OS dispatches each op and returns the result for the LLM to consume.

## Op kinds

| Kind | Purpose | Permission required |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `read_file` | Read a file (optionally a line range) | `file.read` |
| `write_file` | Write (create / overwrite) a file | `file.write` |
| `edit_file` | Replace a string in a file | `file.write` |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file | `file.write` |
| `glob_files` | List files matching a glob pattern | `file.read` |
| `grep_files` | Search file contents by regex | `file.read` |
| `ask_user` | Pause the run and ask the user a question | none (always allowed) |
| `present` | Route bulk data + a declarative view to the user surface without the data passing through LLM output tokens (fire-and-continue) | Tier 0 (always allowed); `data_ref` read authority == `file.read` |
| `render_template` | Render a Jinja2 template against structured data into a string (a sandboxed producer — no side effects, no sink) | `template_ref` / `data_ref` read authority == `file.read`; inline-only is pure computation (no gate) |
| `sandboxed_exec` | Run argv under a `SandboxPolicy` via a `SandboxBackend` (replaces the removed `shell` op) | enforced by backend (`SandboxPolicy`) |
| `web_search` | Search the public web via DuckDuckGo | Tier 1 — default allow; `web.search: deny` in `reyn.yaml` blocks |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch a single URL and return extracted text | Tier 1 — default allow; `web.fetch: deny` in `reyn.yaml` blocks |
| `mcp` | Call a tool on a configured MCP server | `permissions.mcp: [server_name]` in skill frontmatter |
| `mcp_read_resource` | Read one resource (or a resolved resource-template URI) on a configured MCP server | `permissions.mcp: [server_name]` in skill frontmatter (same axis as `mcp`) |
| `mcp_subscribe_resource` | Subscribe to server-pushed `resources/updated` notifications for one resource URI (requires a persistent connection — see below) | `permissions.mcp: [server_name]` in skill frontmatter (same axis as `mcp`) |
| `mcp_unsubscribe_resource` | Cancel a previous `mcp_subscribe_resource` | `permissions.mcp: [server_name]` in skill frontmatter (same axis as `mcp`) |
| `mcp_get_prompt` | Fetch one rendered prompt (messages) by name from a configured MCP server | `permissions.mcp: [server_name]` in skill frontmatter (same axis as `mcp`) |
| `mcp_install` | Install an MCP server from the registry into the project config | `permissions.mcp_install: true` in skill frontmatter |
| `mcp_drop_server` | Remove an MCP server from project/local/user config (inverse of `mcp_install`) | `permissions.mcp_drop_server: true` in skill frontmatter |
| `skill_install` | Register a skill (local dir or git/URL source) into the project skills config | `file.write: [.reyn/config/skills.yaml]` in skill frontmatter; `http.get: [{host: <source_host>}]` when `source` is set |
| `pipeline_install` | Register a pipeline (local DSL file or git/URL source) into the project pipelines config | `file.write: [.reyn/config/pipelines.yaml]` in skill frontmatter; `http.get: [{host: <source_host>}]` when `source` is set |
| `embed` | Raw embedding primitive: batch texts -> vectors (FP-0057 Phase 1; the user-facing primitive AND the shared logic later internal RAG ops call) | none (default-allow; embedding API cost) |
| `index_query` | Semantic vector search over one indexed source | none |
| `semantic_search` | Macro (FP-0057 Phase 2a; renamed from `recall`): per-source-model embed query → index_query per source → merge top-K (multi-model correct) | none (embedding API cost) |
| `index_drop` | Remove an indexed source entirely (destructive) | `permissions.index_drop: ask` in skill frontmatter |
| `index_update` | Incremental/delta-reconcile ingestion into a source's index (add/update/remove/skip; FP-0057 Phase 2a) | none (default-allow; own-write; embedding API cost) |
| `judge_output` | LLM scorer: rubric + threshold + `on_fail` policy | none (LLM cost) |
| `compact` | Voluntarily compact the conversation history (advisory) | none (LLM cost; the mandatory `retry_loop` backstop is independent) |
| `task.create` | Create a Task (`deps` for ordering; `link_type` `awaited`/`background` sets whether a sub-task gates the parent's completion — §2187; sub-task ownership is OS-derived from execution context — §16) | requester-gated (caller becomes requester) |
| `task.update_status` | Declare a status transition | assignee-gated (single-writer CAS on `assignee == caller session_id`) |
| `task.get` | Read one Task record | requester-gated |
| `task.list` | List Tasks (filter by assignee / requester / status); `requester=<task-id>` lists sub-tasks owned by that task | none (filtered read) |
| `task.add_dependency` | Add a depends-on edge (dependency DAG) | requester-gated |
| `task.remove_dependency` | Drop a depends-on edge (idempotent); may promote a now-satisfied dependent | requester-gated |
| `task.repoint_dependency` | Atomically repoint an edge `from_depends_on`→`to_depends_on` (cycle-checked first); re-evals readiness | requester-gated |
| `task.abort` | Remove-op (= delete): archive the task + sub-tree (cooperative-terminal) | requester-gated |
| `task.heartbeat` | Liveness / unblock-predicate trigger for a blocked Task | assignee-gated |
| `task.register_unblock_predicate` | Register a deterministic unblock predicate | assignee-gated |
| `task.comment` | Append a comment to a Task's thread | none |
| `task.assign` | Assign a session to a Task (§27-31 pending-assignment queue): claim an UNASSIGNED task or reassign an assigned one; rebinds the WAL subscription + OS-derives the now-startable status + wakes the new assignee | UNASSIGNED → any session may claim; assigned → current-assignee-gated (owner hand-off) |

## Common envelope

Every op is a JSON object with a `kind` discriminator:

```json
{
  "kind": "read_file",
  "path": "src/foo.py"
}
```

The OS validates the op against its kind's schema, executes it, and returns a result to the LLM.

## File ops (fine-grained)

The LLM-emittable file operations are six fine-grained kinds — the same subset
the chat router exposes as tools (see
[concepts/architecture/llm-invocation-surfaces.md](../../concepts/architecture/llm-invocation-surfaces.md)).
Each is a distinct op kind with its own schema; there is no `op` sub-field.

```json
{"kind": "read_file", "path": "src/foo.py"}
{"kind": "read_file", "path": "src/foo.py", "offset": 100, "limit": 40}

{"kind": "write_file", "path": "out.txt", "content": "..."}

{"kind": "edit_file", "path": "src/foo.py",
 "old_string": "...", "new_string": "...", "replace_all": false}

{"kind": "delete_file", "path": "tmp.txt"}

{"kind": "glob_files", "path": ".", "pattern": "**/*.py", "max_results": 50}

{"kind": "grep_files", "path": "src", "pattern": "def \\w+",
 "glob": "**/*.py", "case_sensitive": false, "max_results": 50}
```

| Kind | Permission | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `read_file` | `file.read` | `offset` / `limit` (line range) optional. |
| `write_file` | `file.write` | Creates or overwrites; parent dirs created as needed. |
| `edit_file` | `file.write` | `old_string` must be unique unless `replace_all: true`. |
| `delete_file` | `file.write` | |
| `glob_files` | `file.read` | `path` defaults to `.`. |
| `grep_files` | `file.read` | `glob` filters which files are searched. |

Permission scopes are configured per-op kind. See `reference/config/permissions.md`.

A successful `edit_file` result additionally carries a `preview` (str): a
numbered-line view (`<lineno>\t<text>`, 1-based) of the changed region — the
lines around where `new_string` landed (±3 by default), so the agent can SEE
*what* changed and at what indentation, not just `{status, replacements}`. It is
**show-not-judge** (numbered lines only — no syntax check or validity verdict),
**language-agnostic** (pure line slicing), and bounded (capped height). For
`replace_all` it shows the first changed region; the count is in `replacements`.

### The coarse `file` execution backend (not LLM-emittable)

The fine kinds above are the only file ops advertised to (and accepted from)
the LLM. They are dispatched through the unified ToolRegistry, then build
a coarse `FileIROp` (`{kind: "file", op: ...}`) internally and route to the
shared `op_runtime/file.py` backend. That coarse `file` kind — dropped from
`OP_KIND_MODEL_MAP` — is **not** an LLM-emittable Control IR
kind. It survives only as:

- the shared execution backend the fine handlers delegate to, and
- the target of OS-deterministic preprocessor `run_op` steps
  (`{kind: file, op: ...}`), the chat host file methods, and the `reyn memory`
  CLI.

Those non-LLM callers also reach extended sub-ops the fine kinds do not
expose — `mkdir`, `move`, `stat`, and `regenerate_index` (used by `reyn memory`
and memory-managing skills via the preprocessor / CLI, never as an LLM-emitted
Control IR op).

## `ask_user`

Pauses the run and asks the user. The OS routes the question through the intervention bus (`ChatInterventionBus` for the inline CUI, `StdinInterventionBus` for CLI) and resumes once the user answers.

```json
{
  "kind": "ask_user",
  "question": "Which model do you want to target?",
  "suggestions": ["light", "standard", "strong"],
  "options": ["light", "standard", "strong"],
  "required": true
}
```

`suggestions` are free-text hints (the user may still type anything). `options` (PR-F3, #2233) is a **closed selectable set** — when non-empty, the frontend renders a **selector** over exactly those answers (empty → free-text input). `required` (default `true`) — when `false`, the user may dismiss without answering.

## `present`

Routes bulk data plus a declarative view to the user-facing surface
**without the data round-tripping through LLM output tokens**. The offloaded ref
file is already "data file + handle"; `present` joins that handle to a view
so the bulk bytes reach the user directly. Presenting N rows costs ~0
output tokens; the moment the agent must *transform* the data it pays to read the
ref instead.

**Tier 0** (`ask_user`'s sibling): presenting to the user — the trust root — is
not an exfiltration channel, so there is no output permission gate. The one gate:
`data_ref` read authority resolves **identically to `file.read`** — `present` can
never read more than the agent's file ops can. Unlike `ask_user`, `present` is
**fire-and-continue** — it does NOT pause the run.

```json
{
  "kind": "present",
  "data_ref": ".reyn/cache/tool-results/2026-.../structured.json",
  "blueprint": {
    "component": "table",
    "rows": {"$bind": "/results"},
    "columns": [
      {"header": "Title", "path": "/title"},
      {"header": "Author", "path": "/author"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Fields (exactly one source; at most one of `view` / `blueprint` — both omitted is
valid, see the PR-1 note below):

- `data_ref` (str) **XOR** `data_inline` (any) — the data source. `data_ref` is
  any zone-readable path; an offloaded `structured_ref` is **re-hydrated to its
  full value** (not read from the LLM-visible preview) via `file.read` semantics.
  `data_inline` is small data already in the LLM's context.
- `view` (str) **at most one with** `blueprint` (object | array) — the view.
  `view` is a registered presentation name (the registry + fallback chain,
  see the PR-B/C/D note below); `blueprint` is an inline declarative component tree.
  (FP-0055 PR-1 renamed this arg from `template` — a clean break, no alias — as
  part of a vocabulary partition: `view` is the declarative sense, `template` is
  reserved for the `render_template` op's Jinja2 text templates.)
- **Both omitted (FP-0055 PR-1):** valid — "no explicit view" routes straight to
  the stage-3/4 default-viewer synthesis below; `present(data_ref=...)` alone
  "just shows" the data.

**Declarative model (v1 catalog — display-only, non-executable by construction).**
A blueprint is a single component node or a list of them (rendered top to bottom).
Catalog components (all read-only): `text` / `markdown` / `code` / `diff` /
`keyvalue` / `table` / `list` / `image`. There are **no interactive components**
(no buttons / forms) in v1. Bindings are expressed structurally as
`{"$bind": "<json-pointer>"}` — an RFC 6901 JSON Pointer **string** (`""` = whole
document); everything else is a literal. `table` / `list` column paths resolve
**row-relative** (relative to each iterated row). The structural gate at op
validation rejects a non-catalog component or a non-path binding (a hard error,
not a soft drop); it is purely structural — leaf-string neutralization is a single
seam in the render layer (below), not at parse.

**Binding semantics.** Path hit → bind. Path miss → **soft-skip** that binding +
record it in `bindings_dropped` (never a hard failure). Type mismatch → coerce (a
scalar into a `table` `rows` slot → a 1-row table) + record. Guard-stripped → a
bound leaf neutralized or size-capped by the presentation-guard is recorded. When
**all** bindings miss, the op reports `all_bindings_missed` (the generic-viewer
fallback signal; the fallback wiring itself is described in the PR-B/C/D note below).

**Presentation-guard (output seam).** Runs **unconditionally**, including for
never-ingested data. Every render-leaf string — labels, literal slot values, AND
bound data values — passes through ONE neutralizer, selected by the target
**surface** (a per-surface strategy, so a future web surface slots in without
touching the binding layer). The v1 **terminal** strategy strips ESC / control
sequences (OSC / CSI) only; it does **not** escape Rich console markup and does
**not** HTML-escape. Rich-markup safety is deliberately NOT this seam's job (PR-B
revision): Rich console-markup injection is reachable only through
`console.print(str, markup=True)` — a choice the *renderer* makes per Rich
object, not a property of the terminal sink. The inline-CUI renderer routes
every leaf into a markup-inert Rich object (`Text` / `Syntax` / `Markdown`) and
never calls `console.print` with markup interpretation on presented content, so
Rich injection is structurally impossible regardless of what the guard does — the
same "safety from shape, not policy" discipline as the guard's own ESC-strip.
HTML neutralization stays a future web renderer's own concern (in a terminal
`<div>` is a harmless literal, and entity-escaping would corrupt `code` / `diff`
content). **Per-binding size caps** prevent a `/` (root) pointer bound into a
`text` component from dumping a whole file. Neutralization is a transform (the
value still renders, inert) — the ref remains the full-fidelity source.

**Ack (op result)** — the LLM's only feedback, deliberately compact + high-signal:

```yaml
ok: true
mode: view        # view | blueprint | default (FP-0055 PR-1) — which input the caller gave
bindings_resolved: 3
rows: 500
bindings_dropped:
  - {path: "/results/0/author", reason: path_not_found}
  # reason ∈ {path_not_found, type_mismatch, guard_stripped}
all_bindings_missed: false
```

`path_not_found` across many rows reads as "view doesn't match this data
shape"; `type_mismatch` as "right path, wrong component"; `guard_stripped` as
"content neutralized by the guard, not a view bug". The LLM self-corrects a
blind presentation for tens of tokens without ingesting the data. With `mode:
"default"` (neither `view` nor `blueprint` given) the stats above are the
synthesized default viewer's own — this is the intended rendering, so there is
no fallback `note` unless that default viewer itself degrades further to the
stage-4 generic fallback.

Event emitted: `presented` (P6 audit) — `{data_ref, view, mode, surface, ingested,
bindings_resolved, bindings_dropped, rows, fallback_stage}`. `view` is the registered name,
`blueprint:<hash>` for an inline blueprint, or `null` when neither was given.
`fallback_stage` (`null` | `content_type_default` | `generic`) records which viewer actually
reached the user — `null` when the requested rendering rendered directly, else the synthesized
fallback stage — so a literal-only view (rendered as requested) is distinguishable from an
unknown / all-missed view that fell through, which otherwise share `bindings_resolved=0`.
`ingested` (`none` | `partial` |
`full`) is **OS-computed** (was the data inline, or does a `read_file` on the ref
appear earlier in the session), never LLM-self-reported. The event carries **refs
+ stats only, never content bytes** (the data is already durable in the ref).

## `render_template`

Renders a Jinja2 template against structured data into a plain string. A general,
sandboxed **producer**: `data + template → string`, with **no side effects and no
sink** — the rendered string is returned as an ordinary op result (canonical `text`;
large output auto-offloads on the chat path). The caller routes it to whatever sink it
wants: `present`, a `write_file`, a message body, or a pipeline `ctx`.

Prefer `present` (declarative) to show structured data to the user — it is
token-economical and portable. Reach for `render_template` only when you need
**computed text**: loops / conditionals / aggregation woven into prose, which
declarative binding intentionally cannot express.

```json
{
  "kind": "render_template",
  "template": "{% for r in data.results %}- {{ r.title }}\n{% endfor %}",
  "data_ref": "runs/summary.json",
  "undefined": "strict"
}
```

Fields:
- `template` (XOR `template_ref`) — inline Jinja2 source string.
- `template_ref` (XOR `template`) — a zone-readable template file path, read as **raw
  text** under `file.read` authority (a template file is source text, never
  JSON-rehydrated).
- `data_ref` (XOR `data_inline`) — any zone-readable path, re-hydrated to its full
  value under `file.read` semantics (the same seam `present` uses).
- `data_inline` (XOR `data_ref`) — a small object already in the LLM's context.
- `undefined` (optional, default `"strict"`) — `"strict"`: an undefined variable is a
  **hard error naming the missing name** (loud-by-default, so a file sink never
  silently writes a broken artifact); `"lenient"`: undefined renders empty and the
  referenced-but-unbound names surface as `undefined_vars` in the result meta.

The resolved data binds under **`data`** in the template context
(`{{ data.results[0].title }}`).

**Sandbox + neutrality.** The engine is always `jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment`
(via the one factory, `reyn.security.template_env.make_sandboxed_env`) — templates may
be LLM-authored, and unsandboxed Jinja2 is arbitrary-code execution (SSTI). A blocked
attribute traversal (`{{ ().__class__ }}`) raises a sandbox violation → a structured
`error` result; nothing executes. `autoescape` is **OFF**: the op returns RAW rendered
bytes. Neutralization is the **sink's** job (a terminal strips control bytes at its
guard, a file is inert, a web surface HTML-escapes) — escaping in the producer would
corrupt file / terminal artifacts.

**Read-authority equivalence.** `template_ref` / `data_ref` resolve through exactly the
`file.read` gate; a denied read → `status="denied"`. render_template can never read
more than the agent's `file.read` can. An inline-only invocation (`template` +
`data_inline`) is pure computation — no read gate.

**Resource bounds.** `SandboxedEnvironment` stops SSTI but not resource exhaustion — a
bounded loop like `{% for i in range(10**9) %}` still floods. The cap is applied
**during** generation (streaming `template.generate(context)`), accumulating against a
max-output-chars budget with a wall-clock backstop; the moment either is exceeded the
render stops and the result is TRUNCATED with a `truncated: true` meta flag naming
which bound fired (`truncate_reason`) — a bounded result, never an OOM / hang. Bounds
default to safety-spirit constants (operator-tunable via `OpContext.render_template_bounds`).

Result fields: `rendered` (the string), `truncated`, `truncate_reason` (when
truncated), `undefined_vars` (lenient mode). An error result carries
`status="error"` + `error_kind` (`template_error` | `security` | `undefined`) +
`error`. No new event type — standard op events; a pure function of (template, data),
so ordinary memo/replay applies.

## `sandboxed_exec`

Executes `argv` under a declared `SandboxPolicy` via the OS's selected `SandboxBackend`. Replaces `shell` for cases that need (or will need, once `SeatbeltBackend` / `LandlockBackend` land) real isolation enforcement.

```json
{
  "kind": "sandboxed_exec",
  "argv": ["echo", "hello"],
  "network": false,
  "read_paths": ["{{workspace}}"],
  "write_paths": ["{{workspace}}/output"],
  "allow_subprocess": false,
  "env_passthrough": ["PATH"],
  "timeout_seconds": 60,
  "stdin": null
}
```

Fields:
- `argv` (required) — command + arguments. `argv[0]` is the executable.
- `network` (optional, default `false`) — allow outbound network.
- `read_paths` (optional) — filesystem paths the process may read (glob patterns OK).
- `write_paths` (optional) — filesystem paths the process may write.
- `allow_subprocess` (optional, default `false`) — may spawn children.
- `env_passthrough` (optional) — env-var names that pass through (others are stripped).
- `timeout_seconds` (optional, default `60`) — wall-clock cap.
- `stdin` (optional, default `None`) — bytes written to the process's stdin, if any (#2593: the pipeline DSL's `shell` step threads the previous step's pipe-data here as JSON).

**Backend selection**: `get_default_backend()` chooses per platform. On macOS < 26, `SeatbeltBackend` (sandbox-exec SBPL). On Linux ≥ 5.13 with the `sandbox-linux` extra installed, `LandlockBackend` (+ optional seccomp-BPF stack). On other platforms or when the chosen backend is unavailable, falls back to `NoopBackend` (audit-only, no enforcement) — emits a one-line WARN on first use. Override via `reyn.yaml` `sandbox.backend` (`auto` | `seatbelt` | `landlock` | `noop`) and `sandbox.on_unsupported` (`warn` | `error` | `ignore`).

Result fields: `returncode`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `truncated`, `backend`.

Events emitted: `sandboxed_exec_started`, `sandboxed_exec_completed` (P6 audit trail).

## `web_search`

Searches the public web using DuckDuckGo and returns structured results. **Tier 1** — default allow; no permission declaration required. Can be blocked project-wide with `web.search: deny` in `reyn.yaml`.

```json
{
  "kind": "web_search",
  "query": "reyn agent OS site:github.com",
  "max_results": 10,
  "backend": "duckduckgo"
}
```

Fields: `query` (required), `max_results` (optional, default `10`), `backend` (optional, default `"duckduckgo"`; currently the only supported value).

Standard DuckDuckGo search operators are supported in `query`:

- `site:<domain>` — scope results to one domain (e.g. `site:news.ycombinator.com`)
- `"phrase"` — require exact phrase match
- `-term` — exclude results containing `term`

Use operators when the user's intent is site-specific or phrase-anchored; plain keywords work otherwise. Results are returned as a list of `{title, url, snippet}` objects under `results`.

## `web_fetch`

Fetches a single URL and returns its text-extracted content. **Tier 1** — default allow; no permission declaration required. Typically used after `web_search` to read a result page in detail. Block with `web.fetch: deny` in `reyn.yaml`; pre-approve silently with `web.fetch: allow`.

```json
{
  "kind": "web_fetch",
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "prompt": "extract the key findings",
  "max_length": 50000
}
```

Fields: `url` (required), `prompt` (optional hint describing what to extract — informational for the LLM, not executed by the OS), `timeout` (optional, default `30` seconds), `max_length` (optional, default `50000` characters).

HTML responses are text-extracted (scripts, styles, and non-content tags stripped). If the content exceeds `max_length`, it is truncated and `truncated: true` appears in the result. Non-HTML responses are returned as-is.

## `mcp`

Calls a tool on a configured MCP server. Requires the server to be declared in `reyn.yaml` under `mcp.servers:` **and** listed in the skill's `permissions.mcp` frontmatter block.

```json
{
  "kind": "mcp",
  "server": "filesystem",
  "tool": "read_text_file",
  "args": {"path": "README.md"}
}
```

Fields: `server` (required — must match a key under `mcp.servers:` in `reyn.yaml`), `tool` (required — tool name as advertised by the server's `tools/list` response), `args` (optional, default `{}`).

> **Advertised name.** Phases advertise this op to the LLM under the chat-tool
> name `call_mcp_tool`; the OS aliases it back to the `mcp` kind at the parse
> boundary. `mcp` remains the canonical kind in `OP_KIND_MODEL_MAP` and on the
> dispatched op.

The OS resolves the server's transport (`stdio`, `http`, or `sse`), dispatches via `MCPClient`, and returns the tool result. Every call emits `mcp_called`, `mcp_completed`, and (on failure) `mcp_failed` events.

See [concepts/tools-integrations/mcp.md](../../concepts/tools-integrations/mcp.md) for server configuration, transport options, and the security model.

## `mcp_read_resource`

Reads one resource (or a resolved resource-template URI) from a configured MCP server. #2597 slice ②a (resources consumption) — gated by the **same** `permissions.mcp` axis as `mcp` (call_tool): a resource read returns external, potentially sensitive server-authored content, so it is permission-gated identically to a tool call.

```json
{
  "kind": "mcp_read_resource",
  "server": "filesystem",
  "uri": "file:///README.md"
}
```

Fields: `server` (required — must match a key under `mcp.servers:` in `reyn.yaml`), `uri` (required — a resource URI as advertised by the server's `resources/list`, or a resolved `resources/templates/list` template).

> **Advertised name.** Phases advertise this op to the LLM under the chat-tool
> name `read_mcp_resource`; the OS aliases it back to the `mcp_read_resource`
> kind at the parse boundary — same pattern as `mcp`/`call_mcp_tool`.

The OS resolves the server's transport, dispatches via `MCPClient.read_resource` (gated on the server's negotiated `resources` capability — see `require_capability` in `mcp/client.py`), and returns `{"contents": [...]}`. Every call emits `mcp_resource_read`, `mcp_resource_read_completed`, and (on failure) `mcp_resource_read_failed` events.

**Discovery is NOT gated.** `list_mcp_resources` / `list_mcp_resource_templates` (the chat-tool names for `MCPClient.list_resources` / `list_resource_templates`) mirror `list_mcp_tools`: no `control-ir` op kind, no permission gate — pure discovery, routed directly through `MCPGateway` from the router host adapter. Only the content-returning read is a gated op kind, matching the existing `mcp` (call_tool) vs. discovery (`list_tools`) split.

`resources/subscribe` + `resources/updated` push notifications are `mcp_subscribe_resource` / `mcp_unsubscribe_resource` below (#2597 slice ②b).

## `mcp_subscribe_resource` / `mcp_unsubscribe_resource`

Subscribe to (or cancel a subscription to) server-pushed `notifications/resources/updated` for one resource URI on a configured MCP server. #2597 slice ②b — the async push event-source: MCP's `resources/subscribe` is a **state-sync/watch** mechanism, not a message queue — the server pushes a thin "this URI changed" signal (no payload), and the OS re-reads (`mcp_read_resource` / `read_mcp_resource`) to see the new content.

```json
{"kind": "mcp_subscribe_resource", "server": "filesystem", "uri": "file:///README.md"}
```

```json
{"kind": "mcp_unsubscribe_resource", "server": "filesystem", "uri": "file:///README.md"}
```

Fields (both kinds): `server` (required), `uri` (required — a resource URI as advertised by `resources/list`).

Gated by the **same** `permissions.mcp` axis as `mcp` / `mcp_read_resource` (subscribing is a stateful action against the server). Gated ALSO on the server's negotiated `resources.subscribe` sub-capability — distinct from the coarser `resources` capability `mcp_read_resource` gates on: a server may support reading resources without supporting subscriptions to them (`MCPClient.subscribe_resource` fails fast with `MCPCapabilityError` if the server didn't advertise `resources.subscribe=True` at connect).

**Persistent connection required.** A subscription is only meaningful on a HELD (session-lifetime) MCP connection — the subscribed-URI set is tracked in-memory on `MCPConnectionService` (runtime-only, no WAL: a subscription carries no data of its own, so it is fully re-establishable and matches the gen-store runtime-only-state invariant). An ephemeral session (whose per-call `MCPClientPool` closes the connection immediately after the op returns) refuses both ops with a clear error rather than silently accept a subscription that can never observe a push.

**Reconnect re-subscribes automatically.** A transport-death reconnect (the same F1 healing path `mcp`/`mcp_read_resource` use) opens a fresh `mcp.ClientSession`, which starts with no subscriptions of its own — `MCPConnectionService` re-issues `subscribe_resource` for every URI still tracked for that server immediately after the fresh connection opens, so a subscription survives a dropped transport transparently.

**The push notification itself is an EventLog event, not a `control_ir_results` value.** When the server sends `notifications/resources/updated {uri}`, `reyn.mcp.message_handler.ReynMCPMessageHandler.on_resource_updated` emits an `mcp_resource_updated` event (`server`, `uri`) onto the session's `EventLog` — asynchronously, independent of any op call. This slice deliberately stops at the EventLog: wiring `mcp_resource_updated` into the hook dispatcher is a later (hooks-arc) slice. Re-reading subscribed resources on reconnect to catch updates missed while disconnected (a resync-READ, distinct from the re-**subscribe** above) is also a follow-up, not this slice.

Advertised to the LLM under the chat-tool names `subscribe_mcp_resource` / `unsubscribe_mcp_resource` — same alias pattern as `mcp`/`call_mcp_tool`.

## `mcp_get_prompt`

Fetches one rendered prompt (its messages) from a configured MCP server. #2597 slice ②c (prompts consumption) — gated by the **same** `permissions.mcp` axis as `mcp` (call_tool) / `mcp_read_resource`: a rendered prompt returns external, potentially sensitive server-authored content, so it is permission-gated identically.

```json
{
  "kind": "mcp_get_prompt",
  "server": "filesystem",
  "name": "summarize",
  "arguments": {"style": "brief"}
}
```

Fields: `server` (required — must match a key under `mcp.servers:` in `reyn.yaml`), `name` (required — prompt name as advertised by the server's `prompts/list` response), `arguments` (optional, default `{}` — rendering arguments matching the prompt's declared `arguments` schema).

> **Advertised name.** Phases advertise this op to the LLM under the chat-tool
> name `get_mcp_prompt`; the OS aliases it back to the `mcp_get_prompt` kind
> at the parse boundary — same pattern as `mcp`/`call_mcp_tool` and
> `mcp_read_resource`/`read_mcp_resource`.

The OS resolves the server's transport, dispatches via `MCPClient.get_prompt` (gated on the server's negotiated `prompts` capability — see `require_capability` in `mcp/client.py`), and returns `{"description": str | None, "messages": [...]}` — each message a flattened `PromptMessage` (`role` + `content`). Every call emits `mcp_prompt_get`, `mcp_prompt_get_completed`, and (on failure) `mcp_prompt_get_failed` events.

**Discovery is NOT gated.** `list_mcp_prompts` (the chat-tool name for `MCPClient.list_prompts`) mirrors `list_mcp_resources`/`list_mcp_tools`: no `control-ir` op kind, no permission gate — pure discovery, routed directly through `MCPGateway` from the router host adapter. Only the content-returning get is a gated op kind, matching the existing `mcp`/`mcp_read_resource` vs. discovery split.

**Prompts have no subscribe concept.** Unlike resources (`mcp_subscribe_resource`/`mcp_unsubscribe_resource`), MCP's `prompts` capability has no server-push notification for a specific prompt's content changing — only the coarser `notifications/prompts/list_changed` (bridged to an EventLog event by `reyn.mcp.message_handler.ReynMCPMessageHandler.on_prompt_list_changed`, independent of this op kind). There is no `mcp_subscribe_prompt` to build.

## `mcp_install`

Installs an MCP server from `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io` into the project's config.
**Phase-only** (not available from the router). Requires `permissions.mcp_install: true`
in the skill's frontmatter **and** user approval.

```json
{
  "kind": "mcp_install",
  "server_id": "io.github.modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
  "scope": "local",
  "env_overrides": {"GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_..."}
}
```

Fields:
- `server_id` (required) — registry identifier (e.g. `"io.github.foo/bar-mcp"`).
- `scope` (optional, default `"local"`) — config tier to write to:
  - `"local"` → `<project>/.reyn/config.yaml`
  - `"project"` → `<project>/reyn.yaml`
  - `"user"` → `~/.reyn/config.yaml`
- `env_overrides` (optional) — pre-supplied secret env values; skip interactive prompt
  for keys present here.

Handler lifecycle:
1. Fetches `server.json` via `RegistryClient`
2. Checks runtime command availability (`npx` / `uvx` / `docker` / `dnx`)
3. Gates via `PermissionResolver.require_file_write` (= `.reyn/mcp.yaml`) + `require_http_get` (= registry host); the legacy `require_mcp_install` bool-axis gate has been removed
4. Prompts for `isSecret=true` env vars via `intervention_bus`; each `save_secret` routes through `PermissionResolver.require_secret_write` (= Phase 6 wildcard `"*"` covers the runtime-determined key set)
5. Writes `mcp.servers.<name>` to the target scope config file
6. Emits `mcp_server_installed` event (P6) — key names only, no values

> **`index_write` removed (still); `embed` re-exposed (FP-0057 Phase 1).** The
> `index_write` control-IR op stays removed — index writing is done
> **provider-direct** inside `reyn.api.safe.embed_index.embed_and_index()` (a
> safe-mode `python` step streams its own chunks into it — the bundled
> `index_docs` / `index_events` chunkers were removed along with the stdlib
> skills that wrapped them). `semantic_search` (FP-0057 Phase 2a; renamed
> from `recall`) still embeds its query provider-direct, per-source-model.
> The `EmbeddingProvider` and `SqliteIndexBackend` primitives are unchanged.
> The `embed` op, however, is **no longer removed**: FP-0057 Phase 1 re-added
> it as the user-facing raw embedding primitive (see the [`embed`](#embed)
> section above) — #1303's "no caller" rationale for removing it is obsolete
> now that the primitive is exposed for user RAG composition. So `kind: embed`
> is emitted again; only `kind: index_write` is not.

## `skill_install`

Registers a skill (from a local directory or a git/GitHub source URL) into the
project's `skills.entries` config. Two tool surface verbs converge on the same
`op_runtime/skill_install.py` handler: `skill_management__install_local` (local
path) and `skill_management__install_source` (git/URL, PR-D, #2548).

Local-path example:
```json
{
  "kind": "skill_install",
  "path": "skills/my-skill",
  "name": "my-skill"
}
```

Source/git example:
```json
{
  "kind": "skill_install",
  "source": "https://github.com/user/skill-repo",
  "name": "my-skill"
}
```

Subdir convention (mirrors Terraform): `"https://github.com/user/repo//skills/my-skill"`
selects the `skills/my-skill` subdirectory inside the cloned repo.

Fields:
- `path` (required when `source` is absent) — path to the skill directory (containing
  `SKILL.md`) or the direct path to the `SKILL.md` file. May be absolute or
  project-root-relative. When pointing at a directory the handler appends `/SKILL.md`.
  Ignored when `source` is set.
- `source` (optional, PR-D) — git or GitHub URL. The handler shallow-clones the repo
  to `.reyn/skills/<name>/`. Subdir inside the repo is specified via `//` separator.
  Requires `http.get: [{host: <source_host>}]` in the caller's permission declaration.
- `scope` (optional, default `".reyn/config/skills.yaml"`) — retained for
  forward compat; currently unused (all installs write to `.reyn/config/skills.yaml`).
- `name` (optional) — config key override. When absent the handler resolves:
  frontmatter `name:` field → directory basename → repo/subdir basename (in that order).
  The resolved name is **sanitized to a single safe path component** (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]`;
  no `/`, `\`, `..`, or leading `.`) — an unsafe name (from caller `op.name` OR third-party
  SKILL.md frontmatter) is **rejected** with `status="error"`, never used to build a path.

Handler lifecycle (source path inserts steps 0a–0d before step 1):
0. **Source path only**: (a) Gate `require_http_get` for the source host. (b) Sanitize the
   candidate name (`_safe_skill_name`) + verify the clone destination is contained under
   `.reyn/skills/` (`_contained_under`) — refuse before any filesystem mutation if either
   fails (path-traversal → arbitrary-rmtree guard). Shallow-clone repo to
   `.reyn/skills/<candidate_name>/`. (c) Locate `SKILL.md` in root or subdir.
   (d) After the frontmatter name is resolved AND sanitized, containment-check + rename
   clone dir if name ≠ candidate.
1. Resolve `SKILL.md` path (dir → `<dir>/SKILL.md` or direct file)
2. Read `SKILL.md` and `split_frontmatter()` — extract `name` and `description`
3. Apply `op.name` override when set
4. Threat-scan description via `content_guard.scan_for_threats(scope="strict")` — block on
   blocking-severity match (source path: removes clone on block)
5. Gate via `PermissionResolver.require_file_write` (= `.reyn/config/skills.yaml`)
6. Write `skills.entries.<name>` to `.reyn/config/skills.yaml` with
   `{path, description, enabled: true, auto_invoke: true}` (+ `source: <url>` when set)
7. Call `record_config_generation` (recovery-core: truncation-surviving snapshot, #2259 / CLAUDE.md gate)
8. Emit `skill_installed` event (P6 audit trail)
9. Request hot-reload via `get_active_hot_reloader().request_reload(source="skill_install")`

Result fields: `status` (`"installed"` / `"blocked"` / `"error"`), `name`, `path`,
`description`, `config_path`, `source` (empty string for local installs).

Events emitted: `skill_install_threat_match`, `skill_install_threat_blocked` (threat scan),
`skill_installed` (P6 on success).

## `pipeline_install`

Registers a pipeline (from a local DSL file or a git/GitHub source URL) into the
project's `pipelines.entries` config. Two tool surface verbs converge on the same
`op_runtime/pipeline_install.py` handler: `pipeline_management__install_local` (local
path) and `pipeline_management__install_source` (git/URL). Mirrors `skill_install`
as closely as possible, reusing its generic path-safety + sandboxed git-clone helpers
verbatim (`_safe_skill_name` / `_contained_under` / `_parse_source_spec` /
`_source_host` / `_shallow_clone` / `_read_yaml` / `_write_yaml` /
`_resolve_project_root` carry no skill-specific logic).

Local-path example:
```json
{
  "kind": "pipeline_install",
  "path": "pipelines/hello.yaml"
}
```

Source/git example:
```json
{
  "kind": "pipeline_install",
  "source": "https://github.com/user/pipeline-repo"
}
```

Subdir convention (mirrors Terraform, same as `skill_install`):
`"https://github.com/user/repo//pipelines/my-pipeline"` selects the
`pipelines/my-pipeline` subdirectory inside the cloned repo.

Fields:
- `path` (required when `source` is absent) — the direct path to the pipeline's
  `*.yaml` DSL file. Unlike `skill_install`, there is no directory-or-file
  resolution — a pipeline registration is always exactly one file. For a source
  install, `path` (when set) selects the DSL file relative to the repo root/subdir;
  when omitted, the repo root/subdir must contain exactly one `*.yaml` file.
- `source` (optional) — git or GitHub URL. The handler shallow-clones the repo
  to `.reyn/pipelines/<name>/`. Subdir inside the repo is specified via `//` separator.
  Requires `http.get: [{host: <source_host>}]` in the caller's permission declaration.
- `scope` (optional, default `".reyn/config/pipelines.yaml"`) — retained for
  forward compat; currently unused (all installs write to `.reyn/config/pipelines.yaml`).
- `name` (optional) — when set, MUST match the DSL's own declared `pipeline:` name
  exactly; a mismatch is refused (`status="error"`). Unlike `skill_install`'s `name`
  (which freely renames the registered key), a pipeline's declared `pipeline:` name
  is ALWAYS the resolution key a `call`/`match` step targets — the config entry key
  cannot diverge from it. When `name` is omitted, the config key defaults to the
  DSL's declared name.

Handler lifecycle (source path inserts steps 0a–0d before step 1):
0. **Source path only**: (a) Gate `require_http_get` for the source host. (b) Sanitize the
   candidate name + verify the clone destination is contained under
   `.reyn/pipelines/` — refuse before any filesystem mutation if either
   fails (path-traversal → arbitrary-rmtree guard). Shallow-clone repo to
   `.reyn/pipelines/<candidate_name>/`. (c) Locate the DSL file (`path` selects it, or
   the sole `*.yaml` file in the repo root/subdir). (d) After the declared name is
   resolved AND sanitized, containment-check + rename clone dir if name ≠ candidate.
1. Resolve the DSL file path (local: `op.path` directly; source: the located clone file)
2. Parse via `parse_pipeline_dsl` — a malformed file is refused (`status="error"`), never registered
3. Resolve + validate the registration name: `op.name` (if set) must match the DSL's
   declared `pipeline:` name exactly; a mismatch is refused
4. Threat-scan the pipeline description via `content_guard.scan_for_threats(scope="strict")` — block on
   blocking-severity match (source path: removes clone on block)
5. Gate via `PermissionResolver.require_file_write` (= `.reyn/config/pipelines.yaml`)
6. Write `pipelines.entries.<name>` to `.reyn/config/pipelines.yaml` with
   `{path, description, enabled: true}` (+ `source: <url>` when set)
7. Call `record_config_generation` (recovery-core: truncation-surviving snapshot, #2259 / CLAUDE.md gate)
8. Emit `pipeline_installed` event (P6 audit trail)
9. Request hot-reload via `get_active_hot_reloader().request_reload(source="pipeline_install")`
   (the existing `"pipelines"` seam — `Session._reapply_pipelines` — rebuilds the registry)

Result fields: `status` (`"installed"` / `"blocked"` / `"error"`), `name`, `path`,
`description`, `config_path`, `source` (empty string for local installs).

Events emitted: `pipeline_install_threat_match`, `pipeline_install_threat_blocked` (threat scan),
`pipeline_installed` (P6 on success).

## `embed`

Raw embedding primitive (FP-0057 Phase 1): a batch of texts in, one vector per text out, in the same order. `embed` is the **user-facing** primitive — the user composes `embed` -> their own external MCP vector-DB's store/search tools via pipeline (reyn hosts no user RAG store). It is also the SHARED logic later internal RAG ops (`index_update` / `semantic_search`, FP-0057 Phase 2) call — same `EmbeddingProvider`, no duplicated embed logic, split only by audience surface.

```json
{
  "kind": "embed",
  "texts": ["first chunk of text", "second chunk of text"],
  "embedding_model": "standard"
}
```

Fields:

- `texts` (list[str], required) — texts to embed. Returned vectors preserve this order.
- `embedding_model` (str, default `"standard"`) — model class (light/standard/strong) or a literal provider model id, forwarded to `EmbeddingProvider.embed`.

Returns: `{"kind": "embed", "vectors": list[list[float]], "model": str, "total_tokens": int}`.

Reuses the existing `EmbeddingProvider` (`RoutingEmbeddingProvider` via `get_provider` — the sole embedder, local sentence-transformers + API classes handled inside the provider); this op is a thin typed envelope, not a re-implementation. Batching (`embedding.batch_size`, default 100) happens inside the provider — the op contract itself is list-in/list-out, batch-granular.

**Redaction-egress seam**: embedding via an API-backed provider sends text content to an external embedding API — a data-egress point. Every text in the batch is passed through a PRE-embed scan (`redact_secrets`, the existing FP-0050 secret-redaction primitive) *before* `provider.embed()` is called, unconditionally (no caller-supplied bypass). A redaction hit fires an `embed_secret_redacted` audit-event. This is a Phase 1 scaffold of the seam using the existing generic secret-redaction pass; the full firm ephemeral-attachment content policy is FP-0057 Phase 3.

Events: `embed_secret_redacted` (`count`, `model`) when the PRE-embed scan redacts one or more texts.

Default-**ALLOW** (compute op — the cost is the embedding API/compute, not a workspace write); individually name-gateable via `contextual_gate` like every other op kind. Additive: does not retire `embed_and_index` (`reyn.api.safe.embed_index`, the CodeAct-only ingestion entry) — that clean-break is FP-0057 Phase 2.

## `index_query`

Semantic similarity search over a single indexed source.

```json
{
  "kind": "index_query",
  "source": "project_docs",
  "query_vector": [0.1, 0.2, ...],
  "top_k": 5,
  "filters": {"path": "docs/concepts"}
}
```

Fields:

- `source` (str, required) — logical source name.
- `query_vector` (list[float], optional) — pre-computed embedding. If `null`, falls back to catalog enumeration (up to `fallback_size_cap` tokens).
- `top_k` (int, default `5`) — number of results to return.
- `filters` (dict[str, str], optional) — metadata key/value filters applied before ranking.
- `fallback_size_cap` (int, default `4096`) — token cap for enumerate fallback when `query_vector` is `null`.

Returns: `{"kind": "index_query", "source": str, "results": [{"text": str, "score": float, "metadata": dict}]}`.

## `semantic_search`

Macro op: embed a query → call `index_query` per source → merge and return top-K results globally. The preferred high-level op for RAG retrieval. **FP-0057 Phase 2a: renamed from `recall`** (clean break — fixes the observed `recall`/`search_actions`/`memory` naming collision; no compat alias).

```json
{
  "kind": "semantic_search",
  "query": "How does crash recovery work?",
  "sources": ["project_docs", "api_reference"],
  "top_k": 5,
  "embedding_model": "standard"
}
```

Fields:

- `query` (str, required) — natural-language query to embed and search.
- `sources` (list[str], required) — logical source names to search. Must not be empty.
- `top_k` (int, default `5`) — number of results returned after the merge/combine step (see below).
- `filters` (dict[str, str], optional) — forwarded to each `index_query` sub-op.
- `embedding_model` (str, default `"standard"`) — fallback model class used ONLY when a source has no recorded model yet (an empty/unindexed source). An already-indexed source's OWN recorded model always wins.

**Multi-model correctness (co-vet #1, load-bearing):** each source's embedding model is **auto-adopted** from its recorded index (`SourceManifest.embedding_model`, falling back to the SQLite backend's `stat().embedding_model`) — never caller-supplied per source. Sources are grouped by DISTINCT resolved model; the query is embedded **once per distinct model** (not once total, not once per source), and each source is queried with its matching model's vector. Cosine scores from different embedding spaces are not commensurable, so the merge is two-tiered: **within** a model group, chunks are merged and sorted by score (safe, same space — this is byte-identical to the pre-rename single-model `recall` behaviour when all sources share one model); **across** groups, each group's already-ranked top-K is combined via an order-preserving round-robin interleave (group order = first appearance in `sources`), capped at `top_k` — raw score magnitudes are never compared across groups.

Returns: `{"kind": "semantic_search", "chunks": [{"text": str, "score": float, "metadata": dict}], "mode": "semantic" | "fallback" | "mixed"}`.

Events: `semantic_search_embed_failed` if a model group's embed call fails (query, model, error).

## `index_drop`

Removes an indexed source entirely — deletes its SQLite backend and manifest entry. **Destructive and irreversible.** Requires `permissions.index_drop: ask` (or explicit `allow`) in skill frontmatter, and triggers a user-approval gate by default.

```json
{
  "kind": "index_drop",
  "source": "project_docs"
}
```

Fields:

- `source` (str, required) — logical source name to drop.

Returns: `{"kind": "index_drop", "source": str, "chunks_dropped": int}`.

Events: `index_dropped` (`source`, `chunks_dropped`).

## `index_update`

Incremental / delta-reconcile ingestion into a source's `IndexBackend` (FP-0057 Phase 2a). **NO full-rebuild mode** — a from-scratch rebuild is `index_drop` → `index_update` on the now-empty source. The caller (a chunker) supplies pre-chunked `chunks`; each chunk carries `content_hash` + `source_path` in its `metadata`. Reconciled against the source's current index, content-addressed by `content_hash` within each `source_path`:

- **add** — new `content_hash`, new `source_path` → embed (via the `embed` op — same primitive, no duplicated embed logic) + insert.
- **update** — new `content_hash`, `source_path` already indexed (content changed) → embed + insert; the path's stale hash(es) are removed in the same pass.
- **remove** — an indexed hash whose `source_path` IS among this call's chunks but whose hash is NOT → deleted. Scoped to the `source_path`s THIS call supplies chunks for — a path never mentioned is left untouched (a partial re-ingest of a few files never mass-deletes the rest of the source).
- **skip** — `content_hash` already indexed → no-op (no re-embed).

```json
{
  "kind": "index_update",
  "source": "project_docs",
  "chunks": [
    {"text": "...", "metadata": {"content_hash": "abc123", "source_path": "docs/a.md"}}
  ],
  "embedding_model": "standard"
}
```

Fields:

- `source` (str, required) — logical source name to ingest into.
- `chunks` (list[dict], default `[]`) — chunks to reconcile; each `{text, metadata}` with `metadata.content_hash` / `metadata.source_path` required.
- `embedding_model` (str, default `"standard"`) — used ONLY when this source has no recorded model yet (first `index_update` for a new source) — an already-indexed source's recorded model always wins (a source is one embedding space).
- `description` / `path` (str, optional) — `SourceManifest` fields, set on first index or override.

**Source-model-bound**: the source's embedding model is recorded on first ingestion and reused on every subsequent `index_update` call for that source.

**Cost surfacing**: `EmbeddingProvider.estimate_tokens` is consulted on the to-embed batch (post pre-embed dedup skip) and compared against `embedding.cost_warn_threshold` (`reyn.yaml`). Exceeding it does not block the op — it emits an `index_update_cost_warning` audit-event and the returned envelope carries a `cost_warning` field, so a large ingestion surfaces its cost instead of embedding silently.

Returns: `{"kind": "index_update", "source": str, "added": int, "updated": int, "removed": int, "skipped": int, "chunk_count": int, "embedding_model": str, "cost_warning": dict | null}`.

Events: `index_update_cost_warning` (`source`, `chunk_count`, `estimated_tokens`, `threshold`) when the to-embed batch exceeds the configured threshold; `index_updated` (`source`, `added`, `updated`, `removed`, `skipped`) on completion.

Default-**ALLOW** (own-write op — writes only to the source's OWN index + manifest, not a destructive cross-cutting op like `index_drop`); individually name-gateable via `contextual_gate`.

## `judge_output`

LLM-based output scorer for evaluation loops. Resolves a `target` dot-path to a value, calls an LLM with the caller-supplied `rubric`, and returns a score (0.0–1.0) plus a pass/fail flag.

```json
{
  "kind": "judge_output",
  "target": "artifact.data.summary",
  "rubric": "Score 0.0-1.0: is the summary concise, accurate, and complete?",
  "threshold": 0.8,
  "on_fail": "transition"
}
```

Fields:
- `target` (str, required): Dot-path to the value being scored (e.g. `"artifact.data.summary"`). Resolved against the current workspace artifact.
- `rubric` (str, required): LLM prompt body. Skill author writes the evaluation criteria. The OS never interprets this content (P7).
- `threshold` (float, optional, default `0.8`): Passing score in `[0.0, 1.0]`.
- `on_fail` (`"transition" | "abort" | "continue"`, optional, default `"transition"`): recorded in the result for the caller to act on. The op handler itself does not branch on this value — it resolves `target`, scores it, and returns; interpreting `on_fail` (e.g. aborting a run) is the caller's responsibility.
- `model` (str | null, optional): Model class override (e.g. `"strong"`). Defaults to the skill's current model.

Returns: `{"kind": "judge_output", "score": float, "passed": bool, "reason": str, "threshold": float, "on_fail": str}`

Audit event: `tool_executed` with `op=judge_output, target, score, passed, threshold, reason` (P6).

**P7 note**: Reyn is rubric-agnostic. The rubric content is part of the skill's authored prompt; the OS only routes it to the LLM without inspection.

## `compact`

Voluntarily compact the conversation history *now*, freeing context window.
The OS injects a **context-size signal** (a `## Context window` header with
the exact-token free window) when the window is filling; the model may
respond by emitting `compact` instead of waiting for the mandatory `retry_loop`
backstop. The op routes to the caller-wired compaction (`force_compact_now`)
and reports the freed tokens + the free window afterwards, in exact tokens
(unit-aligned with the media load-contract error so "should I compact" and
"what fits now" use the same scale).

```json
{
  "kind": "compact"
}
```

Fields:
- `reason` (str, optional): Short model-supplied rationale for the audit trail. The OS never interprets it.

Returns:
- `status: "ok" | "error"`
- `freed_tokens: int` — exact-token reduction. **~0 by construction**: the router prompt is head+tail *turn*-count bounded (`_build_history_for_router`), so compaction does not shrink the bounded view; it compresses the already-elided middle into a summary bridge. Don't front `freed_tokens` here — see the compression metric below.
- `free_window_after` / `free_window_before: int` — exact-token headroom after / before.
- **Compression metric** (the meaningful signal): `summarized_turns: int` (older turns folded into the bridge), `compressed_tokens: int` (their raw token cost), `bridge_tokens: int` (the summary's token cost). The value that matters is the `compressed_tokens → bridge_tokens` compression, not `freed_tokens`.
- On error: `error_kind` (`compaction_unavailable` when no compaction context is wired here; `compaction_failed`) + `error`.

**Events**: `compact_op_requested` / `compact_op_completed` (`freed_tokens`, `free_window_after`, `summarized_turns` / `compressed_tokens` / `bridge_tokens`) / `compact_op_failed` / `compact_op_unavailable` (P6). The inner compaction engine emits its own compaction audit-events.

**Permission**: none required (LLM cost only). Voluntary and independent of the involuntary `retry_loop` backstop, which always runs regardless.

**Visibility**: advertised to the LLM (tool / `available_control_ops`) only when the window is filling — paired with the context-size signal — so it is not offered when there is nothing to compact (mirrors the `search_actions` visibility gate). The permission gate stays "allow"; only *when surfaced* is gated.

## Task ops

First-class trackable work-units. A Task is **opt-in and additive** — the
session model (concurrent / interleaved) is unchanged; a Task is a discrete
handle whose lifecycle is tracked independently. **Completion is an explicit
declaration** (the assignee emits `task.update_status`), never inferred from
session state.

These ops are **term-neutral (P7)**: names + fields are generic; A2A vocabulary
(`contextId`, `TaskState`) maps only at the A2A layer. The op family is gated by
`allowed_ops` (declare `task` for the whole family, or individual `task.*`
kinds); like any op, each is also subject to the per-session contextual gate.

```json
{ "kind": "task.create", "name": "ship-feature" }
{ "kind": "task.create", "name": "sub", "deps": ["<other-id>"] }
{ "kind": "task.create", "name": "bg-sub", "link_type": "background" }
{ "kind": "task.update_status", "task_id": "<id>", "status": "running" }
{ "kind": "task.add_dependency", "task_id": "<id>", "depends_on": "<other-id>" }
{ "kind": "task.abort", "task_id": "<id>" }
```

**Roles.** A Task is owned by two session identities (the per-contextId
routing-key): the **requester** (origin / assigner / disposition notify-target —
the caller of `task.create`, set by the OS, not an op field) and the **assignee**
(the worker session, the single-writer of `status`). Under #2187 backend-master the
assignee is a **rebindable WAL subscription binding** (§27-31), not an immutable field:
it may be **`None` (UNASSIGNED — the pending-assignment queue)** and is changed via
`task.assign` (claim / owner-initiated hand-off / re-queue). On `task.create`: an explicit
`assignee` delegates (or self-assigns); an **owned sub-task** (created while executing a
task — OS-derived ownership, §16) with no `assignee` defaults to the caller (the
decomposition continuation); a **top-level** task with no `assignee` is **UNASSIGNED**
(it waits in the queue until claimed). One session can be the assignee of many Tasks (1 : N).

**Single-writer** is an op-layer CAS `caller session_id == the CURRENT (hydrated) assignee`
(`OpContext.session_id`, threaded by the OS — not an op field, so it cannot be forged),
checked against the rebindable WAL binding; a non-assignee write is rejected. This is
**not** a permission gate (the permission system is resource-scoped, no caller identity at
op-exec). The single-writer invariant (one writer per task) keeps the read-then-check
race-free without a claim token / version.

**Pending-assignment queue (§27-31).** A top-level `task.create` with no `assignee`
produces an **UNASSIGNED** task (no binding, no execute-wake) that sits in the queue —
listed by `task.list status=unassigned`. `task.assign` then binds a session: an UNASSIGNED
task may be **claimed by any session**; an already-assigned task may be **reassigned only by
its current assignee** (owner-initiated hand-off — others request a change via conversation).
Assignment rebinds the WAL subscription, OS-derives the now-startable status
(READY / BLOCKED-by-deps), and wakes the new assignee to execute.

**Role-based op authority (P5).** Each op is gated on the caller's `session_id`:
*assignee-gated* — `update_status` / `heartbeat` / `register_unblock_predicate`;
*requester-gated* — `create` / `add_dependency` / `get` / `abort`; `assign` is
**current-assignee-gated for a reassign but open for an UNASSIGNED claim**. A violation
returns a `role_denied` result.

**`abort` = delete (cooperative-terminal).** `task.abort` is the requester's
remove-op (it absorbs the former `task.archive`): it archives the task **and its
whole sub-tree** (DOWN-cascade, §18). There is **no forced cancel** — the
assignee's in-flight work is rejected by the **terminal-state guard** on
`update_status` at its next write (so no straggler lands, and a sibling task's
work is untouched). This is correct under 1:N (a session owns many tasks) and
needs no cross-session machinery. **UP-notify** (§16): a non-completed terminal
(aborted / failed / cap_exceeded) with **still-alive dependents** notifies the task's
**requester** (the §16 disposition notify-target — the request-owner) to decide recovery.
For an `origin=self` (internal) task the requester's **session is woken** (the slice-7
TaskWaker) so its LLM re-wires the stuck dependents via ordinary task ops (P7 — no
`decision=` vocabulary); for an `origin=external` task the A2A layer routes it to the
external (webhook) channel. The requester is always present, so a **root task is notified
too** (#2107: the prior parent-keyed routing dropped roots). Abort also emits a generic
P6 `task_disposition` event per aborted task (`task_id` / `requester` / `origin` /
`disposition`).

**States (7-state, #2187 §3.4):** `unassigned` (no assignee — the pending-assignment
queue) / `blocked` (deps not all terminal) / `ready` (assigned, startable) / `running` /
`done` / `failed` / `aborted`. Soft-delete (`archived_at`) is an orthogonal retention
marker, not a state.

**Dependency DAG (§13).** `task.add_dependency` and `task.create(deps=[...])` add
depends-on edges through a **shared edge-guard** (completeness): the `depends_on`
task must exist and the edge must not create a cycle. A rejected edge returns a
decision-enabling **error result** (`status="error"`, `error.kind="cycle"` /
`"dep_not_found"`, the offending `edge`, and — for a cycle — the `path`), never a
raised exception. Edge-add is a **pure topology write** — it never flips a task's
status (the requester does not write the assignee's status). A task born with
not-all-completed deps is **OS-derived `blocked`** at create (deps-less tasks keep
their requested status).

**Mutable edges (slice 6-ext).** `task.remove_dependency` drops an edge
(idempotent — a no-op on a missing edge); `task.repoint_dependency` atomically
repoints `from_depends_on` → `to_depends_on`, **cycle-checking the NEW edge BEFORE
any mutation** (a cycle/dangling repoint changes nothing and returns the same
structured error). Both are requester topology writes that go through the same
shared edge-guard, then run the **OS-authority readiness re-derive**.

**Readiness re-derive (OS-authority, P3).** A single primitive derives a task's
readiness over the **pre-run** scheduling states `{pending, ready, blocked}`:
promote `blocked → ready` when all deps are satisfied (incl. a deps-less task —
removing the last dep readies it), re-block `{pending, ready} → blocked` when they
are not. An `in_progress` (the assignee owns the run) or terminal task is left
untouched — this is the single-writer split (the OS schedules pre-run, the
assignee owns the run), and the write **bypasses the assignee CAS** like `abort`.
Completion-recompute (relax → only promotes), `remove` (relax), and `repoint`
(may demote or promote) all share it. A readiness change emits a generic P6
`task_readiness` event.

**Disposition → requester routing (§16, S1 #2134).** When a task reaches a
non-`completed` terminal (`aborted` via `task.abort`, `failed` via
`task.update_status`, or `cap_exceeded` on a per-Task budget cap-hit) and has
**still-alive dependents**, the OS notifies the task's **requester** (the §16
disposition notify-target — the request-owner) to decide recovery — the requester
re-wires via ordinary ops (`repoint` / `remove` / fail / support-self), **not** a
`decision=` vocabulary (P7). If the requester is a **task** (`requester_kind=TASK`
— a task-as-request owns the failed dependent), the OS resolves one hop to that
task's **assignee** (the managing session) before waking. The **requester is always
present** (every task carries one), so a root task is notified too — the prior
`parent_id`-keyed routing silently dropped root-task recovery wakes (#2107). The
**disposition** is carried first-class (in both the P6 `task_dependency_aborted`
event and the requester payload) so a budget `cap_exceeded` is never conflated with
a genuine error `failed` (slice 8). External-origin tasks route via the A2A/webhook
channel rather than an in-session wake.

**Per-Task budget cap (slice 8).** `record_cost(task_id, delta)` accumulates an
LLM call's cost onto the Task's `cost_accum`; when it crosses the Task's
`budget_cap` (an INDEPENDENT cap dimension, enforced alongside the session / daily
caps — the tighter hits first), the OS force-terminates the task (abort-like) and
routes the `cap_exceeded` disposition through the SAME requester-LLM seam — so one
recovery mechanism resolves both a terminal-dependency and a cap-hit. (The
production wiring of the LLM cost recorder to `record_cost` co-lands with the
task-execution engine in a later slice.)

**The TaskWaker (slice 7).** The `OpContext.task_waker` (the OS `TaskWaker`
driver) turns these dispositions into actual session **wakes** via the canonical
`resolve_session → _put_inbox → ensure_session_running` triple: a promoted
dependent (on a predecessor `completed` OR a recovery `repoint`/`remove`) is woken
with a `task_ready` inbox message; a requester (or its managing session) is woken with `task_dependency_aborted`.
Both surface to the woken session's LLM as one router turn (OS-generic inbox kinds,
P7) so it resumes / recovers via ordinary task ops. A **loopless** session (A2A /
MCP, no run-loop) is booted by `ensure_session_running`; a looped one is an
idempotent no-op. This in-process driver is complementary to the cross-process A2A
webhook disposition sweep.

Still landing in later slices: per-task liveness (unblock-predicate / heartbeat
evaluation) — the residual non-terminal-stuck backstop.

**Note for contributors:** When adding a new Control IR op kind to `src/reyn/schemas/models.py` and `src/reyn/core/op_runtime/registry.py`, **also add a section here** in the same PR. The reference and the registry must stay in sync — see [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/tya5/reyn/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) for the rule.

## Where ops are exposed to the LLM

Each op kind's schema and description are held on a `ToolDefinition` (per capability) in the unified `ToolRegistry`. `render_for_router()` renders these into the OpenAI-style `tools[]` array `build_tools()` assembles for the chat router — the LLM picks ops by matching its intent to those descriptions. See [LLM invocation surfaces](../../concepts/architecture/llm-invocation-surfaces.md) for the full mechanism.
