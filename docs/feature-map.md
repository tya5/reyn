# Reyn Feature Map

Full feature inventory of the Reyn Agent OS, extracted from implementation. Each entry links to its reference or concept documentation.

Per-group **Differentiation vs general agents** callouts position each capability against self-hosted general agents (OpenClaw / Hermes) — Skill is one feature among many, not the headline. Maturity marks: entries are production unless tagged **⚗ experimental / MVP** or noted as an **optional dependency**.

#### Time-Travel / Rewind (Resume)

User-facing point-in-time rewind with branching. Phase 1 and Phase 2 (2a/2b/2c/2d) are production. Concurrent-live-fork (parallel live branches) is owner-rejected out-of-scope. Full design: [ADR-0038](deep-dives/decisions/0038-user-facing-time-travel-rewind.md). Change ledger: #1533.

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `/rewind` picker | Interactive checkpoint timeline (seq / timestamp / kind columns); Esc-Esc double-tap shortcut | [How-to: rewind](guide/for-users/time-travel.md) |
| Per-checkpoint anchor preview | Each picker row shows a rendered scroll-hint anchor (#1547) | [How-to: rewind](guide/for-users/time-travel.md) |
| PITR reconstruct | Point-in-time snapshot + WAL-diff reconstruction to target seq | [Time-Travel concepts](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) · [Crash Recovery](concepts/skills/skill-resume.md) |
| Consistent-cut rewind | Both substrates (runtime state + workspace shadow-git `as-of-N`) rewound atomically | [Time-Travel concepts](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) |
| Append-only reset-record | Undo appends a reset-record at seq R; history before R is preserved on the current branch (no destructive rewrite) | [Time-Travel concepts](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) |
| Retention window + GC | Configurable checkpoint retention window; stale snapshots GC'd automatically | [How-to: rewind](guide/for-users/time-travel.md) |
| Branch registry | Abandoned-interval lineage: each fork receives a registry entry with origin seq | [Time-Travel concepts](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) |
| `checkout(seq)` unified primitive | Active-branch seq → undo; inactive-branch seq → fork-switch. One primitive for both directions | [Time-Travel concepts](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) |
| Multi-fork tree UX | Always-tree picker with per-branch anchor labels (#1547 integration) | [How-to: rewind](guide/for-users/time-travel.md) |
| Act-turn runtime-only rewind | Ghost-Replay memo truncate for rewind within an in-flight turn (no substrate round-trip) | [Time-Travel concepts](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) |
| Container-mode shadow-git | Shadow-git `as-of-N` rewind supported inside the container environment backend | [How-to: rewind](guide/for-users/time-travel.md) |

#### Event System (P6)
| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 171 event types | Complete taxonomy: workflow / phase / LLM / tool / budget / permission / etc. | [Events reference](reference/runtime/events.md) · [Concepts: Events](concepts/runtime/events.md) |
| Append-only JSONL | `.reyn/events/<run_id>.jsonl` per-run (`EventStore`); audit trail — append-only, rotation-based (not per-append fsync). Separate log and lifecycle from the recovery WAL (`.reyn/state/wal.jsonl`). | [Events reference](reference/runtime/events.md) |
| Replay | `reyn events <path>` streams events for audit and debug | [reyn events CLI](reference/cli/events.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** the agent loop is an OS-enforced contract — the LLM decides only from OS-provided candidates (P3/P4), every output is schema-validated, every inter-phase value lives in the workspace (P5), and every state change emits an append-only, replayable event (P6). Constrained and auditable by construction, not by developer discipline.

### Chat Engine

#### Chat Compaction

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Head+tail+body budget | Keeps the most-recent turns (tail) and earliest context (head) within per-component token budgets; turns between them are replaced by an LLM-generated summary | [Chat Compaction](concepts/data-retrieval/chat-compaction.md) |
| Overflow retry loop | When the compacted context still exceeds the model limit, budgets for head / tail / summary shrink monotonically per iteration until the prompt fits; fails fast with a structured error when no further reduction is possible | [Chat Compaction](concepts/data-retrieval/chat-compaction.md) |
| Adaptive token estimation | Learns a per-model token-count multiplier over time, reducing estimation drift across sessions | [Chat Compaction](concepts/data-retrieval/chat-compaction.md) |
| Multimodal token estimation | Estimates tokens for text and image content; image parts use a fixed per-part cost | [Chat Compaction](concepts/data-retrieval/chat-compaction.md) |
| Compaction lock | Async mutex prevents concurrent turn appends from racing with an in-flight compaction call | [Chat Compaction](concepts/data-retrieval/chat-compaction.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** instead of naive truncation or an unbounded growing memory, Reyn budgets context as head + tail + LLM summary with a monotonic overflow-shrink retry, adaptive per-model token estimation, and multimodal estimation — predictable context management under a hard model limit.

#### Router system prompt

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Static / dynamic SP split | The router system prompt separates a stable, cache-prefix-friendly head from per-turn dynamic sections | [LLM invocation surfaces](concepts/architecture/llm-invocation-surfaces.md) |
| Task-completion guidance | Anti-fabrication guidance steering the model to finish and verify rather than claim completion prematurely | [SP-improvements study](deep-dives/research/competitive/sp-improvements-measured-1791.md) |
| Model-family-gated steering | A coarse model-family classifier gates non-Claude operational-steering hygiene — added only when the router model is non-Claude, kept off the Claude path | [SP-improvements study](deep-dives/research/competitive/sp-improvements-measured-1791.md) |
| Memory-quality guidance (gated) | Guidance on what makes a good memory entry, rendered only when memory is in scope | [SP-improvements study](deep-dives/research/competitive/sp-improvements-measured-1791.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** these SP improvements are adopted by **design-judgment** (sound + low-cost + non-harmful), not gated on a limited-environment A/B — a measured null on one environment cannot prove a universal negative, so structurally-sound guidance is adopted while genuinely measurable wins are verified separately.

#### Plan Mode

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| LLM plan decomposition | The router LLM decomposes a user goal into an ordered list of named steps with declared dependencies; each step runs in a narrow sub-loop call with a focused prompt and reduced tool catalog | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) |
| Async dispatch | The `plan` tool returns immediately; execution runs as a background task while the user can issue new messages | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) |
| Persistent plan artifact | The decomposed plan is written to the workspace; resume and step replay use the original structure rather than re-decomposing | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) |
| PlanRuntime | Dedicated execution engine for plan-mode, peer to the OS phase runtime | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) |
| Step iteration | Each step runs the router sub-loop up to `step_max_iterations` turns; `retry_limit` caps automatic retries on transient failure with user-approval escalation when the budget is exhausted | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) · [Config: plan block](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#plan-block) |
| Plan resume | Persisted decomposition and per-step result memos allow a plan to resume after crash; completed steps replay without LLM cost | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) |
| Per-step compaction | Each plan step runs its own context compaction budget, independent of the main session | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) · [Chat Compaction](concepts/data-retrieval/chat-compaction.md) |
| Multi-plan concurrency | Multiple plans can be in flight simultaneously; each has its own `plan_id` with results delivered in completion order | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) |
| Operator slash commands | `/plan list` / `/plan discard` / `/plan resume --from <step>` for plan lifecycle management | [Plan Mode](concepts/multi-agent/plan-mode.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** plan decomposition is OS-governed — persisted, resumable per-step (completed steps replay without LLM cost), with per-step compaction and multi-plan concurrency — not an ad-hoc in-prompt task loop.

#### LLM router resilience

Config-gated `litellm.Router` slot-in for provider-resilience. Default OFF (`llm.router.use: false`) — the direct `litellm.acompletion` path is byte-identical. When enabled the Router owns infra retry, Retry-After handling, cooldown, and cross-model fallback; Reyn does not re-implement any of these.

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| litellm.Router delegation | When `llm.router.use: true`, LLM calls route through a `litellm.Router`; Reyn delegates infra-exception retry / Retry-After / cooldown / fallback entirely to the Router | [Config: llm block](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#llm-block) · [Reliability](concepts/agent-engineering/reliability-engineering.md) |
| Default OFF — byte-identical | `use: false` (default) keeps the direct `litellm.acompletion` path with no routing overhead; the on/off switch is the only code-path change | [Config: llm block](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#llm-block) |
| Cross-model fallback chain | `llm.router.fallbacks` maps primary deployments to an ordered fallback list; on primary failure the Router tries each fallback model in order | [Config: llm block](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#llm-block) |
| Retry-After aware retry | `llm.router.num_retries` caps infra retries; the Router natively honours provider `Retry-After` headers (fold of retry-engineering gap) | [Reliability](concepts/agent-engineering/reliability-engineering.md) |
| Per-deployment cooldown | `llm.router.cooldown_time` + `allowed_fails` cools a deployment after repeated failures; subsequent calls route to the fallback chain until recovery | [Config: llm block](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#llm-block) |
| Accurate cost on fallback | On fallback the actual responding model is recorded from `response.model` so cost attribution reflects which deployment served the call | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) |
| Config-fingerprint Router cache | Router is cached per event-loop with a `(model, config-fingerprint)` key; a changed `llm.router.*` rebuilds the Router rather than silently reusing a stale instance | [Config: llm block](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#llm-block) |
| `llm.router.credentials` rotation | Per-model list of API-key env-var names; the Router cycles through active keys; a declared model with zero resolvable keys fails loudly — never a silent keyless deployment | [Config: llm block](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#llm-block) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** provider-resilience is delegated entirely to litellm.Router (Retry-After, jitter, cooldown, cross-model fallback chain, credential rotation) rather than re-implemented — the on/off gate keeps the direct path byte-identical, so replay and cost-recording work unchanged whether or not the Router is active.

### Control IR Ops

All ops are documented in the single reference page: **[Control IR](reference/runtime/control-ir.md)**

The op kinds below mirror `OP_KIND_MODEL_MAP` in `op_runtime/registry.py` (20 kinds — the six `file` sub-ops are grouped into one row).

| Op | Description |
|----|-------------|
| `file` | `read` / `write` / `edit` / `delete` / `glob` / `grep` / `regenerate_index` (six fine-grained registry kinds) |
| `ask_user` | Pause phase, collect user answer, re-run same phase |
| `run_skill` | Invoke sub-skill and return `final_output` artifact |
| `sandboxed_exec` | `argv` under `SandboxPolicy` via platform-selected backend |
| `shell` | Raw shell exec — deprecated; prefer `sandboxed_exec` |
| `web_search` | DuckDuckGo search — Tier 1, default-allow |
| `web_fetch` | URL fetch + text extract — Tier 1, default-allow |
| `mcp` | Call a configured MCP server tool by name |
| `mcp_install` | Install / register an MCP server (registry / package / local source) |
| `lint` | Run DSL linter on a skill directory |
| `index_query` | Vector similarity search over one indexed source |
| `recall` | Macro: embed query → `index_query` per source → merge top-K |
| `index_drop` | Destructive source removal — requires approval |
| `compact` | Summarise / compact context within budget (chat + phase results) |
| `skill_resolve` | Resolve a skill reference to its local / project / stdlib source |
| `judge_output` | LLM scorer with rubric + threshold + `on_fail` policy |

> The `embed` and `index_write` ops were removed in #1303 Stage I — embedding and index-writing now run provider-direct inside `reyn.api.safe.embed_index` and the `recall` op, not as standalone ops. See [Control IR](reference/runtime/control-ir.md).

### Tool-Use Schemes

How tools are presented to the LLM and how its calls are dispatched is a **pluggable scheme**, selectable per layer (`tool_use: {chat, step, phase}` in `reyn.yaml`). The `chat` layer defaults to `enumerate-all` (#1657); `step` / `phase` default to `universal-category`. Non-default schemes are opt-in per layer. All schemes route every tool call through the same OS gate (exclude → permission → dispatch), so the security and validation pipeline is unchanged whichever scheme is active.

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Pluggable scheme protocol | `ToolUseScheme` seam — tool presentation + interpretation + dispatch + feedback behind one interface; schemes are swapped by config, no OS change | [Tool-Use Schemes](concepts/tools-integrations/tool-use-schemes.md) |
| Per-layer selection | Independent scheme per layer — chat / plan-step / OS-phase — via `tool_use` config | [Tool-Use Schemes](concepts/tools-integrations/tool-use-schemes.md) · [`reyn.yaml` § tool_use](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#tool_use-block) |
| `universal-category` (step/phase default) | The universal action catalog — 4 wrappers over every category, qualified-name discover + dispatch | [Tool-Use Schemes](concepts/tools-integrations/tool-use-schemes.md) · [Universal catalog](concepts/tools-integrations/universal-catalog.md) |
| `enumerate-all` (chat default, #1657) | Flat-native-JSON baseline — every usable tool presented flatly, dispatched by name. Best for small tool sets where determinism matters | [Tool-Use Schemes](concepts/tools-integrations/tool-use-schemes.md) |
| `retrieval` | RAG-over-tools — present a search tool, the LLM searches, the OS re-presents matched tools as callable. Supported opt-in for very large tool sets where full-catalog token cost is prohibitive; requires a configured embedding provider (`action_retrieval.embedding_class`) | [Tool-Use Schemes](concepts/tools-integrations/tool-use-schemes.md) |
| `CodeAct` | Code-as-tools — the LLM writes a Python snippet whose in-code `tool()` calls run in a sandboxed subprocess under the same permission gate as a JSON call. Strongest for weak models | [Tool-Use Schemes](concepts/tools-integrations/tool-use-schemes.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** the tool-use strategy is a swappable scheme — `enumerate-all` / `retrieval` / `CodeAct` / the default catalog — chosen per layer by config, *without* changing the OS. Because every scheme dispatches through the same exclude → permission → `dispatch_tool` gate (P4/P5), swapping the LLM-facing tool surface never weakens the security or validation pipeline. The presentation is data; the gate is constant.

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** skills are *one* feature here, not the headline. Where agents like Hermes auto-generate procedure docs (emergent), Reyn's skills (DSL above + this stdlib set) are explicit, typed, and OS-validated — a reviewable, versioned phase graph the OS checks at each transition. The bet is predictable over emergent.

### Permissions

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Tier 0 — always allowed | `run_skill` / `ask_user` / `lint` — no gate | [Permission model](concepts/runtime/permission-model.md) |
| Tier 1 — default-allow | `web_search` / `web_fetch` — deny-only gate | [Permission model](concepts/runtime/permission-model.md) · [Permissions config](reference/config/permissions.md) |
| Tier 2/3 — declaration + 4-layer approval | `shell` / `mcp` / `file` (out-of-zone) / `python` | [Permission model](concepts/runtime/permission-model.md) |
| Layer 1: config pre-approval | `reyn.yaml` hard `allow` / `deny` | [Permissions config](reference/config/permissions.md) |
| Layer 2: saved approvals | `.reyn/approvals.yaml` — persisted per path/server | [reyn permissions CLI](reference/cli/permissions.md) |
| Layer 3: session approvals | In-memory for current invocation only | [Permission model](concepts/runtime/permission-model.md) |
| Layer 4: interactive prompt | Ask user with persist choices (yes / always / just-this-path) | [Permission model](concepts/runtime/permission-model.md) |
| Skill-level declarations | `shell` / `file.read+write` / `http.get` / `secret.write` / `mcp` / `python` / `tool` | [Skill frontmatter](reference/dsl/skill-md.md) |
| CLI gates | `--allow-shell` / `--allow-unsafe-python` required at invocation | [Common flags](reference/cli/common-flags.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** autonomous agents typically execute tools with minimal gating. Reyn requires per-capability declaration + 4-layer just-in-time approval (config → saved → session → interactive), a `.reyn/` write zone, and per-skill credential scoping (Confused Deputy mitigation).

---

### Safety / limit-handling

Bounded-operation checkpoints that stop the agent gracefully rather than hard-failing. See [Safety framework](concepts/runtime/safety.md).

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `handle_limit_exceeded` unified checkpoint | Single shared function `runtime/limits/limit_handler.py` that all seven loop / timeout / budget checkpoints call; owns the 3-mode dispatch, bus interaction, extension bookkeeping, and audit event — callers only decide what limit fired | [Safety framework](concepts/runtime/safety.md) |
| On-limit modes (`OnLimitConfig`) | `interactive` (ask) / `auto_extend` (budgeted N times) / `unattended` (abort) via `safety.on_limit.mode`; applies uniformly to loop caps, timeout caps, and budget exceed paths | [Safety framework](concepts/runtime/safety.md) · [reyn.yaml § safety](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#safety-block) |
| Force-close wrap-up | On a denied limit the LLM gets one final tool-less turn to summarise what was accomplished; delivered as a `kind="agent"` message with `meta.limit_stopped` | [Safety framework](concepts/runtime/safety.md) |
| `limit_denied` event | P6 audit event on every deny path (`max_iterations` / `router_cap`) | [Events reference](reference/runtime/events.md) |
| Decision-enabling fallback | When the wrap-up fails or is empty, a structured error states the limit hit, the config key to change, and partial-data availability | [Safety framework](concepts/runtime/safety.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** where free-running agents hard-stop or run away at a limit, Reyn's force-close turns a denied limit into a graceful LLM wrap-up plus an operator decision — it reports what it accomplished instead of vanishing or looping unbounded.

---

### Content-layer defense

Scanning untrusted content (memory, tool results, context files, inbound peer messages) for
prompt-injection / exfiltration / role-hijack patterns at the seams where it
enters the prompt — a security transform at a content boundary, not OS decision
logic. Design: [content-threat scan proposal](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md).

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Threat-pattern library ✅ | Security-domain regexes (injection / exfiltration / role-hijack / exec) applied to untrusted content across all scopes — `security/threat_patterns.py` | [Design](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md) |
| Content fence ✅ | Wraps untrusted content in explicit delimiters so model-visible boundaries are unambiguous — `security/content_fence.py` | [Design](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md) |
| Unified tool-result guard ✅ | One seam scans + fences tool-result content before it reaches the prompt — `security/content_guard.py` | [Design](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md) |
| Memory-write BLOCK ✅ | Memory writes that match threat patterns are blocked before reaching the agent's memory store — `runtime/router_loop.py` | [Design](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md) |
| Pre-exec command scan ✅ | `sandboxed_exec` scans the full joined argv against exec-scope threat patterns before any shell is launched; blocked commands emit `exec_threat_blocked` — `core/op_runtime/sandboxed_exec.py` | [Design](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md) |
| Context-file + A2A-inbound fence ✅ | Operator-editable context files (REYN.md/AGENTS.md) and untrusted inbound A2A peer messages are fenced + scanned on arrival — `router_host_adapter.py` (EP3) / `a2a_handler.py` (S4b) | [Design](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md) |
| Compaction secret redaction ✅ | Secret-looking content is stripped from compaction input before summaries are persisted — `security/secret_redaction.py` | [Design](deep-dives/proposals/0050-content-threat-scan.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** Reyn places content-layer scanning at the OS seams — the same content boundaries where secret interpolation already sits — as a security-domain transform that keeps OS decision logic free of skill strings (P7). Structural redundancy means checks already enforced by the sandbox / permission layer (e.g. absolute-path or pipe-to-shell writes) are not re-implemented as ad-hoc per-call scans.

---

### Budget & Cost

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Per-agent caps | Token + USD hard limits with `warn_ratio` | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) |
| Per-chain caps | Skill spawn count + token total per chain | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) |
| Rate limits | Per-model calls-per-minute sliding window | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) |
| Daily quotas | Persistent JSONL ledger, resets at local midnight | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) |
| Monthly quotas | Persistent JSONL ledger, resets at month boundary | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) |
| Crash-durable cap counters | Every cap counter (daily / monthly / per-agent token+USD / per-chain spawn count) is reconstructed on startup from the fsync-per-append ledger — a crash inside the throttled `budget_state.json` save window cannot under-count a cap and re-allow over-budget calls or spawns. The state file is a best-effort cache; the ledger wins on recovery | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) · [state-dir](reference/config/state-dir.md) |
| `extension_calls` (+ `safety.on_limit.mode`) | Budget-extension flow on hard cap hit; `extension_calls > 0` opts the dimension into the unified `safety.on_limit` policy (ask / auto-extend / deny). The per-dimension `ask_on_exceed` bool was removed in #1877. | [Budget config](reference/config/budget.md) |
| High-cost model warn (`cost_warn`) | `cost_warn.enabled` (default `true`) emits a `model_cost_warn` event + inline conv-pane marker when the resolved model's input cost per 1M tokens exceeds `model_threshold_per_1m_input_usd` (default `5.0`); fires at `/model` switch and session startup, de-duped once per model per session | [reyn.yaml § cost_warn](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#cost_warn-block) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** token + USD caps per agent / chain / model with refuse-on-exceed and a `safety.on_limit`-driven extension flow, plus a pre-selection high-cost model warning — runaway spend is structurally bounded, not merely observed after the fact.

---

### Memory & RAG

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| LiteLLM embedding backend | Any provider via named model class config | [RAG concepts](concepts/data-retrieval/rag.md) |
| Local embedding backend | sentence-transformers via `pip install 'reyn[local-embed]'` — `local-mini` / `local-e5` classes, credential-free, GPU-optional via `REYN_EMBED_DEVICE` | [RAG concepts § Local embedding backend](concepts/data-retrieval/rag.md#local-embedding-backend-fp-0043) · [Guide](guide/for-users/enable-semantic-search.md) |
| Provider-prefix routing | `sentence-transformers/` → local backend; anything else → LiteLLM | [RAG concepts § Embedding configuration](concepts/data-retrieval/rag.md#embedding-configuration) |
| Batch embed | Configurable `batch_size` with concurrency semaphore | [RAG concepts](concepts/data-retrieval/rag.md) |
| Dimension table | Static lookup for OpenAI / Voyage / Cohere | [RAG concepts](concepts/data-retrieval/rag.md) |
| SQLite index per source | `.reyn/index/<source>/index.db` with WAL mode | [RAG concepts](concepts/data-retrieval/rag.md) |
| Chunk dedup | `content_hash` upsert prevents re-indexing | [RAG concepts](concepts/data-retrieval/rag.md) |
| `recall` op | embed → `index_query` per source → merge top-K globally | [Control IR](reference/runtime/control-ir.md) |
| Action embedding index | `ActionEmbeddingIndex` (SQLite-WAL, class-swap detection, cross-process build lock) — backs the `search_actions` tool the chat LLM uses | [Universal catalog § search_actions](concepts/tools-integrations/universal-catalog.md#what-stays-out-of-phase-1) · [`reyn embeddings`](reference/cli/embeddings.md) |
| Memory CRUD | `list` / `read` / `remember_shared` / `remember_agent` / `forget` | [Memory concepts](concepts/data-retrieval/memory.md) · [reyn memory CLI](reference/cli/memory.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** beyond chat memory, Reyn ships a RAG *framework* — you declare an indexing strategy as a `skill.md` (LLM-picked chunking + a deterministic embed/write chain) over a pluggable `IndexBackend`, with a credential-free local-embedding option. A foundation to build on, not a fixed memory feature.

---

### MCP

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| stdio transport | Subprocess `StdioServerParameters` — implemented | [Concepts: MCP](concepts/tools-integrations/mcp.md) |
| HTTP transport | Streamable HTTP with request headers — implemented | [Concepts: MCP](concepts/tools-integrations/mcp.md) |
| SSE transport | Reserved — raises `NotImplementedError` | [Concepts: MCP](concepts/tools-integrations/mcp.md) |
| `mcp serve` | Expose Reyn agents as an MCP server over stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 | [reyn mcp CLI](reference/cli/mcp.md) |
| `mcp install` | Fetch from registry, gate permissions, write config, store secrets. Three chat verbs: `mcp__install_registry` (official registry), `mcp__install_package` (npm/pypi/docker/github URL), `mcp__install_local` (direct command). CLI: `reyn mcp install <SERVER_ID>` or `--source <SPEC>`. | [Concepts: MCP](concepts/tools-integrations/mcp.md) · [reyn mcp CLI](reference/cli/mcp.md) |
| Secret management | Per-server env vars in `~/.reyn/secrets.env` | [reyn secret CLI](reference/cli/secret.md) |
| Tool dispatch | Lazy-load and cache `MCPClient` per server connection | [Concepts: MCP](concepts/tools-integrations/mcp.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** Reyn is both an MCP client (consumes external servers) and an MCP server (exposes its own agents) — standard-protocol interop in both directions, with stdio MCP servers subprocess-sandboxed under Seatbelt (#1344).

---

### Web & Protocol

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| FastAPI gateway | REST + WebSocket server on `localhost:8080` | [reyn web CLI](reference/cli/web.md) |
| WebSocket chat | `/ws/chat` for interactive browser sessions | [reyn web CLI](reference/cli/web.md) |
| A2A Agent Card | Per-agent `/.well-known/agent-card.json` capability declaration | [reyn web CLI](reference/cli/web.md) |
| A2A `message/send` | Synchronous JSON-RPC 2.0 single-turn endpoint per agent | [reyn web CLI](reference/cli/web.md) |
| A2A agent discovery | `GET /a2a/agents` server-level listing | [reyn web CLI](reference/cli/web.md) |
| A2A async tasks | `async_mode` → `Task` envelope; `GET /a2a/tasks/{run_id}` poll, `…/events` SSE stream, `…/cancel`; mid-run `ask_user` surfaces as `input-required` | [A2A concepts](concepts/multi-agent/a2a.md) |
| Webhook push | Status-transition POSTs to `params.webhook_url` for async tasks (`reyn.web.notifications`) | [A2A concepts](concepts/multi-agent/a2a.md) |
| MCP-over-SSE | `/mcp/sse` + `/mcp/messages` for MCP client connections | [reyn web CLI](reference/cli/web.md) · [reyn mcp CLI](reference/cli/mcp.md) |
| REST API | `/api/*` for agents / skills / runs / topologies / budget / permissions | [reyn web CLI](reference/cli/web.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** competitors specialise in broad, deep connectivity to the messaging apps you already use. Reyn keeps connectivity to standard protocols — MCP (client + server), A2A (sync + async tasks with webhook push), and a REST / WebSocket gateway — rather than per-app integrations.

---

### TUI

The Textual terminal interface for `reyn chat` (`src/reyn/interfaces/tui/`).

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Conversation view | Streaming conversation with inline thinking rows and tool-call rendering | — |
| Right Panel tabs | Live side panels: Agents / Cost / Docs / Events / Keys / Memory / Pending | — |
| Tool-result viewer registry ✅ | `register_viewer` seam replaces inline content-type dispatch; `register_content_type_viewer(content_types, viewer, *, match="exact"\|"prefix"\|"substring")` provides the ergonomic MIME shorthand — delegates to `register_viewer` so name/position behave identically | [Tool-result viewers reference](reference/tui/tool-result-viewers.md) |
| LLM-generated template fallback ✅ | On registry miss, `_generate_template` async-generates a `TemplateSchema` (label/value rows + caption) via LLM call; `_apply_template` renders it with label escape and row/caption caps (`_MAX_TEMPLATE_ROWS=8`, `_MAX_CAPTION_CHARS=40`) | [Tool-result viewers reference](reference/tui/tool-result-viewers.md) · [FP-0051 proposal](deep-dives/proposals/0051-tool-result-viewer-registry-llm-template.md) |
| Email-diff viewer ✅ | Concrete viewers for `message/rfc822` (email from/subject card) and `text/x-diff` / `text/x-patch` (syntax-highlighted patch); registered before the generic JSON viewer so declared content-type takes priority | [Tool-result viewers reference](reference/tui/tool-result-viewers.md) |
| Input + command palette | Input bar with slash commands (`/plan`, `/compact`, `/find`, `/help`, `/clear`) via a command palette | — |
| Intervention widget | In-TUI `ask_user` prompt rendering | — |
| Chainlit web chat (⚗ PoC) | Alternative browser chat UI sharing the same agent — `reyn chainlit` + `chainlit_app/` (agent picker, settings, uploads, slash routing); coexists with the TUI | — |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** Reyn's chat surface is a local, inspectable TUI with live audit panels (events / cost / permissions) beside the conversation — the operator sees what the agent is doing and spending in real time.

---

### Intervention

Cross-surface `ask_user` and permission routing — the same prompt reaches the operator over whichever surface is active (`chat/services/intervention_registry.py`).

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| InterventionBus family | `ChatInterventionBus` (TUI) / `StdinInterventionBus` (CLI) / `A2AInterventionBus` (web) / `_MCPInterventionBus` (MCP) | [Permission model](concepts/runtime/permission-model.md) |
| InterventionRegistry | Tracks pending interventions and pairs each answer back to the waiting run | — |
| `ask_user` lifecycle | Pause run → surface prompt → resume on answer; async wait works across surfaces | [Control IR — ask_user](reference/runtime/control-ir.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** human-in-the-loop is a first-class, surface-agnostic primitive — a permission ask or `ask_user` routes to the operator identically whether the agent runs in the TUI, CLI, web / A2A, or MCP.

---

### Sessions and identity

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Three-level model | `Agent` (identity) → `Session` (conversation) → `SkillRuntime` (per-skill OS-runtime host) | [Concepts: Sessions](concepts/multi-agent/sessions.md) |
| Multiple Sessions per Agent | One identity, many parallel conversations; `AgentRegistry` maps name → {sid → Session} with a shared `Agent` identity | [Concepts: Sessions](concepts/multi-agent/sessions.md#multiple-sessions-vs-multiple-agents) |
| Identity vs conversation scope | Memory / permissions / workspace / peer-addressing live on the Agent; history / inbox-outbox / current task stay per-Session | [Concepts: Sessions](concepts/multi-agent/sessions.md#what-a-session-owns) |
| Per-session persistence | Each Session is snapshotted and restored independently (WAL-backed; snapshot re-keyed per Session) | [Concepts: Sessions](concepts/multi-agent/sessions.md#what-a-session-owns) |
| Global-cut time-travel | `/rewind` moves *every* Session and Agent to the target checkpoint atomically (one global single-seq WAL) — per-Session granularity is in persistence, not the rewind | [Concepts: time-travel](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) |
| Multi-session crash recovery | On restart the full name → {sid → Session} structure is reconstructed from event log + snapshots, not just one conversation | [Concepts: time-travel](concepts/runtime/time-travel.md) |
| Transport routing-key | Default: native conversation-id → Session (namespaced, auto-spawn/resume). Explicit: join an existing Session by id (non-existent = error). Scoped within one Agent | [Concepts: Sessions](concepts/multi-agent/sessions.md#transports-route-to-sessions) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** the Agent / Session / runtime split is the mainstream agent-platform shape (cf. Assistant / Thread / Run); Reyn's distinction is what sits *beneath* it — every Session is event-sourced, permission-gated, and independently persisted, so one identity can hold many isolated conversations, with a single global consistent-cut rewind across them all.

---

### Multi-Agent

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Agent registry | Named agents with role profiles + `history.jsonl` | [reyn agent CLI](reference/cli/agent.md) |
| `network` topology | Full mesh — any member to any member | [Topology YAML](reference/dsl/topology-yaml.md) · [reyn topology CLI](reference/cli/topology.md) |
| `team` topology | Star around leader — member-to-member forbidden | [Topology YAML](reference/dsl/topology-yaml.md) |
| `pipeline` topology | Ordered — each member sends only to next | [Topology YAML](reference/dsl/topology-yaml.md) |
| `_default` topology | Auto-synthesized full mesh for unassigned agents | [Multi-agent config](reference/config/multi-agent.md) |
| MessageBus | Quiescence-based coordination with `reply_to` correlation | [Multi-agent config](reference/config/multi-agent.md) |
| `delegate_to_agent` | Async-dispatch to peer with topology permission gate | [Concepts: principles P4](concepts/architecture/principles.md) |
| Agent hops cap | Max delegation depth via `safety.loop.max_agent_hops` | [reyn-yaml § safety](reference/config/reyn-yaml.md#safety-block) |
| `chain_id` propagation | Trace multi-hop chains in P6 events | [Events reference](reference/runtime/events.md) |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** delegation is topology-gated (network / team / pipeline) with a hop-depth cap and `chain_id` audit propagation — multi-agent reach is bounded and traceable, not free-form.

---

### Sandbox

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** tool / code execution runs under an OS-level sandbox (Seatbelt / Landlock + seccomp-BPF) with an explicit `SandboxPolicy`, rather than unsandboxed tool calls. Stdio MCP servers are also subprocess-wrapped under Seatbelt (#1344).

### Environment — ⚗ Stage 2 (experimental MVP)

Repo-filesystem mechanism abstraction (FP-0008 #1115) decoupling the workspace from where the repo FS lives. The host backend is production; the container backend is an exec-per-op MVP. See `src/reyn/environment/`.

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `EnvironmentBackend` protocol | Abstracts repo-FS read / write / exec away from the OS + permission layer | — |
| `HostBackend` | Default — identity over the local filesystem (production) | — |
| `DockerEnvironmentBackend` | ⚗ Stage 2 MVP — repo FS + exec inside a Docker container (`--container` attach); exec-per-op | — |
| Mount-mode launcher | ⚗ container launch with the repo mounted (#1324) + `devcontainer.json` awareness / build-on-demand (#1341) | — |

> **Differentiation vs general agents:** Reyn adopts the container-exec pattern those agents popularised (e.g. Hermes docker-exec), but keeps the OS + permission + audit layer on the host while only the repo FS lives in the container — sandboxed execution without surrendering governance. (⚗ Stage 2 / experimental.)
