"""Single chokepoint for the first real ``import litellm`` in a process.

``litellm``'s own package init pulls in a huge module tree (~1.5s cold-import
cost). Every reyn call site that touches litellm does so lazily, inside a
function — see ``reyn/__init__.py`` for the full inventory + the #2928
``LITELLM_LOCAL_*`` env-var defaults that must be set before ANY of them run.
This module adds the SECOND piece: routing litellm's own console log output
(StreamHandlers it attaches to its "LiteLLM" / "LiteLLM Router" / "LiteLLM
Proxy" loggers, unconditionally, at import time) to reyn's log file instead of
stderr, so an interactive CUI session's terminal is never corrupted by a
litellm banner or warning.

``ensure_litellm_ready()`` is the ONE place that should perform this
first-import work. Callers that need the ``litellm`` module still do their own
``import litellm`` afterward (cheap — Python caches the module), but calling
``ensure_litellm_ready()`` first guarantees the log-routing patch is active
for whichever call site happens to import litellm first in a given process.

    litellm's ``_logging.py`` module attaches a fresh ``logging.StreamHandler()``
    (→ stderr, by construction) to each of ``"LiteLLM"`` / ``"LiteLLM Router"`` /
    ``"LiteLLM Proxy"`` **unconditionally at import time** (module-level code,
    not gated on whether the logger already has a handler) — the first
    ``import litellm`` anywhere in the process attaches it, which happens
    inside this context manager's ``with`` body when routed through
    ``ensure_litellm_ready``. Because the attach is unconditional, merely
    pre-configuring these loggers *before* import does not stop litellm from
    ALSO adding its own console handler — it would just add a second one. So
    the console redirect has to intercept handler *construction* itself: for
    the duration of the ``import litellm`` this swaps in a
    ``logging.StreamHandler`` subclass whose default stream is reyn's log file
    instead of stderr, so every StreamHandler litellm builds at import time —
    including the one behind the cost-map-fetch-failure warning
    ``litellm.litellm_core_utils.get_model_cost_map`` emits synchronously
    during import — writes to the file, not the console.

    On exit, the real ``StreamHandler`` class is restored and the three
    loggers are stripped down to file-routed only: their handler lists are
    cleared and ``propagate`` is set ``True``, so every *runtime* litellm log
    (not just the import-time one) flows to the root logger's file handler
    exactly once, with no leftover console sink. This also makes the
    context manager safe to use when litellm was already imported earlier in
    the process (e.g. by an unrelated call site's own lazy import racing ahead
    of ``ensure_litellm_ready``) — the patch during ``import litellm`` becomes
    a no-op (module cache hit, nothing re-runs), but the handler-strip on exit
    still redirects it.
