"""SkillRegistry — per-agent coordinator for active skill snapshots + WAL.

A `SkillRegistry` owns the lifecycle of in-flight skill runs for a single
agent. It is the only object that mutates per-skill snapshot files and
emits skill-lifecycle WAL events (`skill_started` / `skill_phase_advanced`
/ `skill_completed`). Callers (the runtime, future resume entry) talk to
the registry, not to snapshots directly.

Responsibilities:
  - Allocate / load / save / delete per-skill snapshots
  - Append skill-lifecycle events to the global WAL
  - Surface `list_active()` for AgentRegistry's truncation floor calc
    and for the future resume runtime entry
  - Stay agnostic about phase execution mechanics (kernel / OSRuntime)
    — the registry only sees lifecycle bookmarks, never op execution

Design invariants:
  - Per-skill snapshot is a CACHE; the WAL is the source of truth.
    Crash-loss of the snapshot is recoverable by replaying WAL events
    from `applied_seq=0` for that run_id.
  - Snapshot is mutated only via this registry's methods. External
    code reading the file (e.g. AgentRegistry's truncation floor calc)
    must treat the file as eventually-consistent and fall back to
    safe defaults on parse error.
  - One registry instance per (agent_name, project_root). Process can
    hold many registries — one per agent.
  - All WAL appends use `agent=<agent_name>` so AgentSnapshot's
    `_matches_agent` routes them to the right agent on replay (PR21).
