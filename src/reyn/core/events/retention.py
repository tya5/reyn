"""Retention policy + truncation floor clamp (ADR-0038 Stage 1e, D5).

Two retention windows: a fine **WAL** window and a coarse **generation** window.
The user-facing knob is generation-count (`keep_generations` = "undo back N
checkpoints"); the WAL fine-window is *derived* (keep WAL back to the oldest
retained generation's base). `keep_duration` / `keep_bytes` are optional
secondary axes. **Default = live**: no deeper retention, the floor is the current
live floor (`min(watermark)+1`) — fully backward compatible.

The clamp consolidates the retention knobs into one policy and guarantees the
compaction floor never rises past what `reconstruct` needs for any *retained*
point — the concrete form of the Stage 1c-1 `maybe_truncate` caveat.

    """Lowest seq that must remain so the retention window is reconstructable.

    ``floor = min(live_floor, oldest_retained_generation_base)``. **Live policy →
    ``live_floor``** (no clamp). With ``keep_generations = N``, the oldest
    retained checkpoint is the N-th most recent in ``checkpoint_seqs`` (its seq is
    the gen base WAL replay starts from); the floor is clamped *down* to it so the
    last N checkpoints stay reconstructable.

    **Rewind records and the floor**: a rewind record at seq ``R`` abandons
    ``(N, R)``; for it to affect a retained seq ``S >= floor`` we need
    ``N < S < R``, hence ``R > S >= floor`` — so any rewind record whose
    abandoned interval touches the retained window has ``R >= floor`` and is kept.
    This argument is correct for runtime-state reconstruction (WAL replay uses
    only seqs >= floor), but ``history.jsonl`` is append-only and never
    floor-truncated: ``_active_branch_history`` tests the branch model
    (``build_active_predicate``) against ``wal_seq`` anchors from
    ``history.jsonl`` that may be below the floor (abandoned-branch turns).
    Dropping a rewind record below the floor therefore lets abandoned
    conversation turns reappear in the LLM context. Fix: callers of
    ``truncate_below`` pass ``always_keep_kinds=frozenset({REWIND_KIND})``
    (``snapshot_generations.REWIND_KIND``) so reset-records survive truncation
    regardless of the floor.

    Note that this protection is what makes the record survive; it is NOT what
    makes the branch model notice. The model's rewind-record index is
    incremental (#2939), so it re-reads the WAL only as it grows — a rewrite is
    caught by file identity and forces a rebuild. Truncation and the index are
    therefore independent: keeping a record here keeps its abandoned interval,
    and dropping one drops it, either way from the file that now exists.
