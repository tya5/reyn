"""Canonical tool-result shape — the #2425 案B spec fix (guessing-free offload).

The spec hole (owner): tool results are heterogeneous per tool, so the offload layer GUESSED which
field is the LLM body (per-op ``_offload_payload_field`` marker + ``decide_payload_field``'s
sole-oversized rule) and broke whenever a result had a second large field (owner's chat-MCP
whole-envelope: a large ``structuredContent`` alongside ``content``).

案B normalizes every tool result at the boundary into ONE canonical shape the offloader never has to
interpret:

- ``text``        — the single canonical LLM-readable body (the ONLY thing the offloader truncates).
- ``attachments`` — typed non-text kept OUT of the offload decision so a large one never competes with
                    ``text``: ``{"kind": "media"|"structured", ...}``. A large ``structured`` is
                    separately referenced (not dropped, not mixed into ``text``, retrievable by ref).
- ``source_ref``  — the re-fetch origin for an on-disk body (``{"path": …, "offset": …}``); ``None``
                    for a transient body (MCP/web/exec) — which must therefore be offload-stored (the
                    tool cannot be meaningfully re-run for more).
- ``meta``        — small structured signal the LLM reads inline as YAML frontmatter (``returncode``,
                    ``truncated``, …). High-signal-only: transport identifiers (``kind``, duplicate
                    ``status``, ``server``, ``tool`` echo) are dropped — they never change what the
                    LLM does next. ``isError`` is retained as the sole error-path driver.

FP-0056 PR-F1 — coverage enforcement by construction (this module's endgame). The pre-F1 design had
two structural defects the 2026-07-09 dogfood incident exposed (a ``reyn_repo__read`` doc read
offloaded as a whole-dict ``structured`` blob instead of the readable body):

1. **Free-floating ``_MAPPERS`` dict, hand-synced with the op/tool registries.** Nothing forced
   "registered a producer" to imply "declared its LLM-visible shape", so ``file`` / ``reyn_repo`` /
   admin ops silently took the fallback. **Fix:** the canonical declaration is now *born at the
   registration seam* — an op kind declares it through ``op_runtime.register(kind, handler,
   canonical=…)``; a router ``ToolDefinition`` declares it through its required ``canonical`` field.
   ``_MAPPERS`` is gone; declarations live in :data:`_DECLARATIONS`, populated from both seams.
2. **Dispatch sniffed ``result["kind"]`` — data a producer may not even set (``reyn_repo`` had none).**
   **Fix:** :func:`to_canonical` dispatches on the *invoked identity* (``source=`` — the tool/op the
   chokepoint called), NOT the result dict. ``result["kind"]`` stops being load-bearing for
   canonicalization; it stays ordinary result data. This fixes the kind-less-handler class outright.

A registry-derived CI gate (``tests/test_fp0056_canonical_coverage_gate.py``) walks every registered
op kind + every ToolDefinition and asserts each carries a declaration — catching design-level
omissions a hand-written table misses (it WOULD have caught the ``file`` gap).

A declaration is a **mapper** (``result -> CanonicalToolResult``), the explicit named opt-in
:data:`STRUCTURED_PASSTHROUGH` (the whole dict legitimately IS the LLM view — admin/install ops, owner
decision #1), or :data:`CANONICAL_TODO` (declared but a real mapper is not yet written — a provisional
whole-dict fallback, ratcheted so it can't become a permanent escape hatch; burn-down in issue #2681).
A genuinely unregistered ``source`` (dynamic/edge, or ``None``) keeps the lossless whole-dict fallback;
PR-F2 adds the ``canonical_fallback_used`` visibility event (degrade-with-audit) on the TODO + unknown
paths.

FP-0056 v2 closes the three canonical silent-loss modes structurally: piece #1 the shared error seam
(M1, ``error_to_canonical`` before every mapper), piece #2 the runtime ``canonical_degraded`` invariant
(M2, a success-mapper returning empty), and piece #3 (this) the inner-dispatch FAIL-VISIBLE seam (M3):
a mapper whose inner discriminator is missing/unknown raises :class:`CanonicalDiscriminatorMiss` instead
of emitting status-only garbage (the #2695 ``"None: ok"`` — non-empty so M2's empty-check misses it, not
an error so M1's seam misses it); :func:`to_canonical` catches it and rides the EXISTING whole-dict
fallback + ``canonical_fallback_used`` (reason ``"discriminator_miss"``).

P7: the source → canonical mapping is OS-level (no domain-specific vocabulary). The deref / paging /
offload store machinery is reused unchanged — 案B removes only the field-guessing.

    - a health-check-style ``{ok: False, service: "db"}`` (``ok:False`` MEANS "DB is down" — success

      ``meta.isError`` handling (:func:`_is_error`) precisely because their payload is NOT a message.

    was shown to the LLM as a whole-dict ``structured`` blob instead of clean text).

    ``shell`` is #2593 thin pipeline-DSL sugar over ``sandboxed_exec`` whose ``_handle`` (locked design)
    returns ONLY the command's STDOUT — JSON-decoded when it parses (so ``verify: schema`` can apply to
    a JSON-emitting command), else the raw text. ``stderr``/``returncode`` never reach this seam (they
    are dropped one layer up, by that same locked design) — the one respect this mapper CANNOT mirror
    ``sandboxed_exec_to_canonical`` (whose ``returncode`` signal meta this would carry, were it visible
    here); ``meta`` is therefore always empty for ``shell``.

    The shape THIS mapper actually receives (post ``unwrap_dispatch_envelope``) is one of:

    - the dispatch envelope ``{"status": ..., "data": <value>}`` — the common case (a plain-text
      command, or JSON stdout that decoded to a non-``dict`` such as a list/number/bool/``None``: the
      envelope could not be peeled because peeling requires a ``dict`` ``data``);
    - ``<value>`` directly when stdout decoded to a ``dict`` (already peeled one envelope layer).

    Either way, mirroring ``sandboxed_exec``'s "stdout IS the text" treatment: ``value`` renders as the
    readable ``text`` body — verbatim when it is already a ``str``, else ``json.dumps``'d so a
    JSON-emitting command's output stays fully legible — and there is NO ``structured`` attachment (the

    C: write/ack/spawn-ack producers with no readable body).

    ``render(result)`` renders the short human/LLM-readable status line (the producer-specific
    phrasing — "Saved '<slug>' to <path>.", "Spawned agent '<name>'.", "Removed N chunk(s).", …).
    ``meta_keys`` names the top-level result fields that ride along as structured ``meta``
    (frontmatter) — the SAME fields the pre-burn-down whole-dict fallback carried; a key absent from
    a particular result shape is silently skipped (lets one factory call cover a producer with more
    than one success sub-shape, e.g. ``mcp_install``'s ``ok`` vs ``needs_secrets``).

    SUCCESS shape only — FP-0056 v2 piece #1 (the shared error seam) routes any
    :func:`is_error_result` shape through ``error_to_canonical`` BEFORE a mapper runs, so ``render``
    only ever sees a success/status dict.

    ``status:"cancelled"`` (#2813) is DELIBERATELY not folded into the shared error seam —
    :func:`is_error_result`'s own docstring (Tightening A) explains why a bare ``status`` value must
    never be a standalone error trigger (a producer may give ``status`` a success-data meaning, e.g.
    sandboxed_exec's nonzero-exit). So this factory checks for it directly, BEFORE calling ``render``:
    every ``make_status_text_mapper``-built canonical (mcp_install / mcp_install_local /
    mcp_subscribe_resource / mcp_unsubscribe_resource, at present) would otherwise fall through to
    ``render``'s SUCCESS-only phrasing (e.g. "Installed MCP server '…'.") for a cancelled install that
    wrote NOTHING — a false-positive success report caught in #2813 co-vet. ``meta_keys`` still ride
    along (server_id/server_name/uri/... identify WHICH call was cancelled)."""

    ``seam.py``'s attachments reduction but with NO size gating: pipeline ctx retains full values
    for downstream programmatic step processing (owner ruling).

    ``meta`` is the producer's SIGNAL channel — the small, high-signal fields a mapper deliberately
    kept out of the body because they change what the caller does next: ``embed``'s ``model``/
    ``total_tokens``/``cost_usd``/``priced``, ``sandboxed_exec``'s nonzero ``returncode``, an MCP
    result's ``isError``. The chat side has always seen these (``seam.py`` reads ``meta``); the
    pipeline side did not, so a ``tool:`` step could read a producer's body but never its signal.

    FP-0063 P3 (#2966) is why this is no longer acceptable: the ingest pipeline must stamp each
    chunk's ``embedding_model`` from the model that ACTUALLY produced the vectors (FP-0057 C4 —
    "one source = one embedding model"). Without ``meta``, the pipeline's only available source was
    its own INPUT, which is typically a model-CLASS alias (``"standard"``) rather than the resolved
    id — i.e. the per-chunk ``embedding_model`` column would record a model that never produced
    those vectors. That is precisely the "the column becomes a lie" failure FP-0057's C1 hard gate
    exists to prevent (it is why a vector-DB server with a built-in embedder is rejected); reaching
    it via the ctx reducer instead of via the server would have defeated the gate's purpose by
    another route. Exposing ``meta`` makes C4 correct BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by documentation.

    Absent-when-empty mirrors ``structured``'s own convention exactly: a mapper that emits no signal
    meta (the common case — most successful results have none) adds no key, so a step reading
    ``ctx.<name>.meta`` on such a producer fails loudly rather than silently reading ``{}``. Use
    ``get(ctx.<name>, "meta.<field>", <default>)`` for safe navigation (see pipeline-dsl.md)."""
