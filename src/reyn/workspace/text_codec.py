"""#1452: single-source text codec — decode/encode ladder for file ops.

`file__read` / `grep` / `file__edit` / `write_file` all need to turn raw bytes
into text (and back) without (a) dumping garbled binary into context, (b)
silently mis-decoding legacy encodings (SJIS / EUC-JP / UTF-16) to replacement
chars, or (c) silently transcoding a non-UTF-8 file on edit. This module is the
ONE place that decides — extracted so every consumer shares it (the extract-the-
seam pattern, cf. #1446's op-context bridge).

Decode ladder (`decode_text_or_none`): BOM → UTF-8 fast-path → NUL-sniff binary
reject → charset-normalizer detection. Re-encode (`encode_text`) round-trips
through the detected codec (restoring a BOM for utf-8-sig/utf-16/utf-32), and
returns None when the text is not representable (→ the caller errors instead of
corrupting the file).

    1. **BOM first** — UTF-16/32 ASCII text is NUL-heavy and would be mis-rejected
