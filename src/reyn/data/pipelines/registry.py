"""reyn.data.pipelines.registry — config-entries → PipelineRegistry loader.

The production population path for the pipeline feature. Pipelines are
registered PURELY via explicit ``pipelines.entries`` declarations in config —
the same registration model as ``reyn.data.skills.registry.build_skill_registry``
and ``mcp.servers`` (clean break: the prior directory-scan model — a blind
``scan_dirs`` glob over a ``pipelines/`` directory for any ``*.yaml`` file
present — is removed; a DSL file with no config entry is invisible to every
session).

Unlike skills (explicit ``entries`` config, metadata only, never parses the
file), a pipeline must be PARSED to be usable — the ``PipelineRegistry`` stores
live ``Pipeline`` objects and surfaces their name+description to the LLM (IS-5's
D19 catalog enumerator). So this loader parses each entry's ``path`` via
:func:`~reyn.core.pipeline.parser.parse_pipeline_docs` (a file may hold MORE
than one ``pipeline:`` document — #2722) and registers EVERY parsed pipeline.

**Namespacing is ALWAYS ON (#2722).** A registered pipeline's global name is
uniformly ``{entry-key}.{local-name}`` — for every pipeline, regardless of how
many ``pipeline:`` documents the file holds. The config entry key is PURELY a
namespace label; it no longer needs to equal any pipeline's declared name (the
old ``key == declared-name`` coupling is gone). A single-``pipeline:`` file
under ``entries: {orders: {path}}`` whose doc is ``pipeline: main`` registers as
``orders.main`` — there is no bare-name registration anywhere.

``call``/``match`` target resolution is a clean dot/no-dot dichotomy (#2722),
applied HERE (the loader owns the entry key; the parser stays config-agnostic —
H4):

  - a **dot-less** target (``call: {pipeline: helper}``) is a same-file SIBLING
    reference — it resolves to ``{entry-key}.helper``. An unresolved sibling (no
    ``pipeline:`` doc named ``helper`` in the same file) is a load-time error
    (fail-loud; NO silent fallback to some unrelated global).
  - a **dotted** target (``call: {pipeline: other.helper}``) is a GLOBAL
    reference — left unchanged, resolved against the whole registry at run time.

Because ``.`` is reserved in both declared names and entry keys (#2722 R1 — a
dot-less name has 0 dots, a global has exactly 1), dot-presence alone
classifies a reference with no ambiguity.

Failure posture is PER-ENTRY ISOLATED, not process-fatal: a malformed DSL file,
an unreadable path, an entry key containing the reserved ``.`` (R1), an
unresolved dot-less sibling reference, an intra-file duplicate declared name
(R2), or a duplicate global name across entries are each caught INSIDE the
``entries`` loop — logged as a Python ``logging`` warning AND durably emitted as
a ``pipeline_load_failed`` P6 event (via ``emit_cli_event`` — see its own
docstring; this loader has no per-session ``ctx``/``EventLog`` handle threaded
in, and is called from multiple distinct entrypoints, so the session-independent
sink is the right fit), then SKIPPED — the remaining entries still load. This
was changed from an earlier fail-loud design (raise straight out of
``build_pipeline_registry``) because ``SessionFactoryConfig.from_config``
(``reyn/runtime/factory_config.py``) calls this with no enclosing try/except,
at EVERY session construction — so one broken pipeline entry anywhere in
``pipelines.entries`` crashed reyn's ENTIRE startup (`reyn chat` / `reyn web`),
not just that one pipeline. Visibility is still preserved (the warning + event
carry the exact same descriptive message the old raise would have) — this is
NOT the fully-silent ``skills.registry`` pattern (a typo must not silently
vanish with zero trace); it is "visible but non-fatal".

Duplicate GLOBAL name across entries (``{entry-key}.{local-name}`` collision —
possible only if two entries share the same key, or a namespaced name coincides
with another): the FIRST-registered entry with that name wins; a later entry
that collides is the one skipped/logged (dict iteration order = config
declaration order — the first entry an operator listed keeps its registration).

``raw_pipelines=None`` (the util/no-root path) → an empty registry; an
empty/absent ``pipelines:`` block or an empty ``entries`` map → an empty
registry (zero pipelines is a valid, non-error state — same as skills). These
are the only cases where ``build_pipeline_registry`` returns early WITHOUT
even entering the per-entry loop — they are not "failures", just an absent
config shape, so nothing is logged.

``strict=True`` (opt-in, default ``False``) restores the ORIGINAL fail-loud
posture — the first per-entry failure raises :class:`PipelineLoadError`
straight out of ``build_pipeline_registry``, with NO logging/eventing (the
raise itself is the signal). This exists for ``Session._reapply_pipelines``
(``reyn/runtime/session.py``, the ``pipelines`` hot-reload seam): that seam
needs ATOMIC last-good-registry semantics — reject the ENTIRE rebuild on any
broken entry and keep serving the old registry unchanged, rather than
silently dropping just the broken pipeline from a live session's registry
graph mid-reload (a "the pipeline this operator was relying on just vanished
from the running session" surprise). Session-factory construction
(``SessionFactoryConfig.from_config``) is the opposite case — a NEW session
about to start has no "old registry" to fall back to, so ``strict=False``
(the default) is the right posture there: isolate the bad entry, keep the
good ones, let the session start.
