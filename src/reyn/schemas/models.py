    result whose bulk auto-offloads on the chat path; the caller routes it to any
    sink (``present``, a ``write_file``, a message, or a pipeline ``ctx``).
    Neutralization of the raw output is the SINK's job, never the producer's
    (producer-neutrality: a file is inert bytes, a terminal strips control bytes at
    its guard — different sinks disagree about what is dangerous).

    Template source (exactly one): ``template`` — an inline Jinja2 source string —

    **Normal (tool-facing) use**: set only ``event_name`` (+ optional
    ``payload``). The emitted kind is ALWAYS ``llm:<session_id>:<event_name>``
    — the session component is supplied ONLY by ``OpContext.session_id`` at
    handler-execution time (structural session-binding, §8.4 item 3): the
    router tool schema (``reyn.tools.emit_hook_event``) exposes ONLY
    ``event_name``/``payload``, never a session, so a well-behaved LLM tool
    call cannot even express a foreign session.

    ``target_kind`` is a **defense-in-depth escape hatch, deliberately NOT
    exposed in the router tool's JSON schema** (an LLM function-call cannot
    set it through the normal path). It exists so (a) the OUT-set kind
    whitelist (``reyn.hooks.schema_registry.is_emittable_llm_kind``) has a
    REAL, exercisable subject — proposal §8.4 item 3 requires the whitelist
    be an enforced reject, not a dormant check that can never actually fire
    — and (b) any OTHER caller of this Op model (e.g. a future Control-IR
    surface) is held to the exact same gate. The handler validates
    ``target_kind`` (when set) through the SAME ``is_emittable_llm_kind``
    whitelist BEFORE ``HookBus.publish`` — a non-self-session or
    non-``llm:*`` ``target_kind`` (``builtin:*``/``composed:*``/
    ``webhook:*``/``mcp:*``, or another session's ``llm:*``) is REJECTED,
    never reaches the bus, and is never used to route anywhere (this
    OpContext's ``hook_bus`` is a single fixed reference — there is no
    lookup-by-session-id path for the handler to route a mismatched
    ``target_kind`` to a different session's bus even if the whitelist were
    absent). ``composed:*`` in particular must never be LLM-forgeable — a
    forged ``composed:*`` event would fire a composed-only hook without the
    correlation logic a real Composer enforces before publishing
    (anti-spoofing, proposal §1/§2).

    ``event_name`` is schema-constrained (#2890 F6): a ``pattern`` restricts
    it to ``[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`` and a ``max_length`` caps it, so control
    characters / newlines / unbounded length can never flow into the
    constructed ``kind`` (and from there into the P6 audit-event / anything
    that renders ``kind`` for display) even though the kind is already
