"""MCPConnectionService — per-session held-open MCP connections (#2597 S2a).

#2597 slice ③ (elicitation): every held connection installs an
``elicitation_handler`` (see :mod:`reyn.mcp.elicitation`), built fresh on
every open/reopen alongside the existing ``ReynMCPMessageHandler`` (mirrors
the S2b per-open handler-rebuild pattern). ``elicitation_bus``/
``elicitation_gate`` (both optional, mirroring ``hook_trigger``'s None-
default no-op pattern) are the SAME "fixed bus + per-call gate" split #2095's
shell-hook consent uses (``session.py`` wires ``consent_bus=
self.as_request_bus()`` / ``consent_gate=lambda: self._interventions.
has_active_listener()``) — see :meth:`_resolve_elicitation_bus`.

Option C from the S2-pre spike (owner-delegated, do not relitigate): a persistent MCP
connection lives as a service INSIDE the agent's own session — not a separate driver
session. The spike proved the key precondition: FastMCP holds its client session in a
dedicated ``asyncio.Task``, so a client opened in task A is safely ``call_tool``'d from
task B on the SAME event loop. That is what makes holding connections open across
unrelated chat turns (which may run in different asyncio Tasks) safe, unlike
:class:`~reyn.mcp.pool.MCPClientPool` (a359 P2), whose ``get()`` fails fast off its
owning task because ITS contract is per-turn/task-affine by design.

Replaces the per-call open->close model on the live (non-ephemeral) session MCP path:
the pool opened + closed a fresh ``MCPClient`` (subprocess/HTTP session) on every single
tool call, which is correct but wasteful — this service opens each configured server
ONCE and reuses it for the rest of the session's lifetime.

Pool-compatible surface: ``get(server, config, *, agent_id=None) -> MCPClient`` matches
:meth:`MCPClientPool.get` byte-for-byte, so :class:`~reyn.mcp.gateway.MCPGateway` (the
one seam every MCP op flows through) works UNCHANGED when constructed with
``MCPGateway(pool=connection_service, ...)`` — it never has to know which kind of pool
it was handed.

Reconnect-on-demand (S2a-level resilience — deliberately NOT S2b's background health
loop / ping): a subprocess death or HTTP disconnect mid-session does NOT flip
``MCPClient.is_initialized()`` or the underlying ``fastmcp.Client.is_connected()``
(verified empirically against the real echo test server's ``die`` tool — both stay
True after the transport is gone) — the only observable signal is an exception raised
on the NEXT use. So the held-connection handle catches that signal, discards + reopens
the dead connection so the NEXT call lands on a healthy transport — a dropped
connection must not permanently wedge the server for the rest of the session.

#2597 F1 fix (post-S1 over-catch): ``MCPClient`` wraps EVERY exception (transport
death, application-level protocol errors, capability-gate refusals) into some
``MCPError`` subclass — so catching bare ``MCPError`` here would reconnect a perfectly
healthy connection on a capability-gate refusal or an app-level error (e.g. an unknown
tool/resource), needlessly killing+respawning a live stdio subprocess. ``_heal`` below
catches ONLY :class:`~reyn.mcp.client.MCPTransportError` — the narrower subclass
``reyn.mcp.client`` raises (via its ``_is_transport_death`` predicate, verified against
fastmcp 3.4.2 + the mcp SDK) exclusively for genuine transport-death. A
``MCPCapabilityError`` (gate refusal) or a plain ``MCPError`` (app-level) propagates
WITHOUT touching the connection.

CRITICAL — the reconnect must NOT silently retry a side-effectful call (at-most-once):
post-S1 ``call_tool`` raises ``MCPError`` on ANY transport failure, including the
drop-AFTER-execution window (the server RAN the tool, then the connection dropped before
its response arrived). Auto-retrying the same call on the fresh connection would
RE-EXECUTE the tool — an at-most-once → at-least-once regression vs the pre-S2a per-call
pool (a duplicated ``create_issue`` / ``send_email`` / counter increment). So the two op
classes are healed differently:

  - :meth:`_HeldConnection.call_tool` — **reconnect-then-propagate**: on ``MCPError``,
    heal the connection (reopen) but RE-RAISE the original error. The call is NOT
    retried, so a tool is executed at most once. The first ``call_tool`` right after an
    idle drop fails once; the healed connection makes every subsequent call succeed
    (S2b's proactive ping loop will detect the drop BEFORE the next call, delivering
    transparent healing SAFELY — S2a does not trade correctness for that UX).
  - :meth:`_HeldConnection.list_tools` — **retry-once**: an idempotent read is safe to
    re-run on the fresh connection, so it heals transparently (no user-visible failure).

Either way the fault the caller ultimately sees is contained by the existing MCPGateway
boundary into an LLM-visible error result, same as the pre-S2a per-call path.

Runtime-only state (S2a scope note): held connections are NOT WAL-derived / recoverable
state — they are reconstructed fresh (lazy-connect) after any process restart, exactly
like the pool's per-call clients were. Nothing here writes to the WAL.

#2597 S2b: because the connection stays open, FastMCP's ``session_task`` keeps its
receive loop running, so server-pushed notifications (tools/prompts ``list_changed``,
``notifications/progress``) arrive on the wire even between calls. ``emit_sink`` /
``tools_cache_invalidate`` (both optional; None = no bridge, byte-identical to pre-S2b
behaviour) are threaded down to a per-server :class:`~reyn.mcp.message_handler.
ReynMCPMessageHandler` built fresh each time :meth:`_ensure_open` opens (or reopens, on
reconnect) a held client — see that module for the notification->EventLog bridge design.

#2597 slice ②b — resource subscriptions (Q4, decided, do not relitigate): the
subscribed-URI set is RUNTIME-ONLY, in-memory, per server, held on THIS service
(``self._subscriptions``) — never WAL'd. A subscription carries no data of its own (MCP's
resources/subscribe is a thin "something changed, re-read if you care" signal, not a
message queue — see ``reyn.mcp.client.MCPClient.subscribe_resource``'s docstring), so it
is fully re-establishable and matches the gen-store runtime-only-state invariant. The
consequence: a fresh session (post-restart) starts with NO subscriptions (same as a fresh
``MCPClient`` starts with none), and a RECONNECT within the same live session (the F1
transport-death path) must explicitly RE-ISSUE ``subscribe_resource`` for every URI
tracked for that server on the fresh client — a brand-new ``mcp.ClientSession`` has no
memory of what the OLD (now-dead) session's client subscribed to. :meth:`_ensure_open`
does this re-subscribe immediately after opening a NEW client (whether that is the very
first open, where the tracked set is empty and the loop is a no-op, or a reconnect, where
it is the whole point) — see that method's inline comment.

#2608 H1 — external-event->hooks bridge (the first slice of the external-event arc):
``hook_trigger`` (optional, mirrors ``emit_sink``'s None-default no-op pattern) is an
ASYNC callable ``(point, template_vars) -> Awaitable`` — in practice a closure over the
owning session's ``HookDispatcher.dispatch``. It is never called directly from the MCP
receive-loop task (:class:`~reyn.mcp.message_handler.ReynMCPMessageHandler` runs
SYNCHRONOUSLY there and cannot ``await`` it — see that module's docstring). Instead this
service exposes :meth:`enqueue_external_event` — a SYNCHRONOUS, non-blocking
``put_nowait`` onto a BOUNDED ``asyncio.Queue`` (``_HOOK_EVENT_QUEUE_MAXSIZE`` entries)
— and drains it with a single background task (:meth:`_drain_hook_events`) running on
THIS service's (= the session's) event loop, which is what actually ``await``s
``hook_trigger``. Two invariants this buys:

  - **The receive loop never blocks and never stalls** on a slow/stuck hook — enqueue is
    O(1) and non-blocking; on overflow (a burst of resource updates arriving faster than
    hooks can be dispatched) the newest event is DROPPED + logged, never queued
    unboundedly and never backpressured onto the receive loop. This is the same
    "never stall / never delay other notification routing" discipline the module
    docstring establishes for the synchronous EventLog emit.
  - **Per-session dispatcher identity holds naturally**: because ``MCPConnectionService``
    is constructed per-session (see ``session.py``), the ``hook_trigger`` closure it is
    given targets THAT session's own ``HookDispatcher`` — a resource update on session A's
    held connection can only ever fire session A's hooks.

The drain task is lazily created on first ``enqueue_external_event`` call (mirrors the
lazy client-open pattern elsewhere in this class) and cancelled in :meth:`aclose`.
``hook_trigger=None`` (the ephemeral ``MCPClientPool`` path, or any session that never
wires one) → :meth:`enqueue_external_event` and the whole queue/drain-task machinery
never activate — byte-identical to pre-H1 behaviour.

#2597 P1 — reconnect resync-read (follow-up to ②b, higher-priority now that H1 makes a
missed update a missed hook fire): ②b re-subscribes every tracked URI on a
transport-death reconnect (the loop in :meth:`_ensure_open`, described above), but a
resource that actually CHANGED while the connection was dead never produced a
``resources/updated`` push — that notification simply never arrived on the dead
transport, and the fresh ``mcp.ClientSession`` has no way to redeliver a notification it
never received. Q4 (S2-pre spike, decided, do not relitigate): reyn keeps NO resource
content cache — subscriptions are runtime-only (see ②b's docstring above), so there is
no baseline to diff the post-reconnect content against and no way to know WHICH tracked
URIs, if any, actually changed during the down window. The chosen trade-off:
conservatively treat every reconnect as an implicit "may have changed, re-read if you
care" signal for every re-subscribed URI, rather than silently dropping a real update. So
:meth:`_ensure_open` distinguishes the very first open for a server (``_ever_opened`` has
not seen it yet — nothing to resync, no synthetic emit) from a RE-open (``is_reopen`` —
the same server was already opened once before in this service's lifetime): on a
re-open, after each successful re-subscribe, it calls
:meth:`~reyn.mcp.message_handler.ReynMCPMessageHandler.emit_resource_updated` (the
producer factored out of ``on_resource_updated`` for exactly this reuse) with
``resync=True`` — the SAME event type, through the SAME emit_sink + H1 hook-trigger
path a real push uses, so EventLog subscribers and H1 hooks fire identically to a real
push. A possibly-spurious re-read on a (rare) reconnect is cheap; a silently dropped real
update is not.
