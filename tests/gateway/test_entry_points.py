"""Tier 2: reyn.webhooks entry points resolve to the gateway plugin modules.

Regression backstop for #1807. The plugins→gateway rename (#1807/#1816) moved
the code (``src/reyn/plugins`` → ``src/reyn/gateway``) but the ``pyproject.toml``
entry points still pointed at the deleted ``reyn.plugins.*`` — so webhook plugin
discovery (``load_webhook_plugins`` → ``ep.load()``) silently failed at runtime
(``ModuleNotFoundError`` caught + skipped). No test exercised entry-point
resolution, so CI stayed green while inbound webhook plugins were broken.

This pins resolution against the installed entry-point metadata: ``ep.load()``
raises ``ModuleNotFoundError`` if the target module is wrong, so a future rename
that forgets the entry points fails here instead of silently in production.

Local dev note (#2374 follow-up): a STALE editable install can false-fail this. If
``src/reyn.egg-info/entry_points.txt`` predates the #1807 rename it still lists
``reyn.plugins.*`` and duplicates the fresh dist-info, so ``entry_points()`` returns
BOTH and the ``eps[0]`` pick may be the stale one. ``pip install -e .`` regenerates it.
CI is unaffected (it installs clean).
